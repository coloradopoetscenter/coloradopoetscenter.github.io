  <h1>Now  I candle</h1>  <p>Now I candle<br /> The egg  that is our mother,<br /> Translucent  curl<br /> On white  sheets,<br /> Her  breasts<br /> Like  worn socks<br /> Across a  messy bed.<br /> Slipping  her red hand<br /> Down her  puddle of <br /> Belly,  she holds the<br /> Nest of  nakedness<br /> Between  her legs<br /> Waiting,  wordless<br /> For the  white hen.</p>
