  <h1>White  Rain</h1>  <p> Although  it is summer evening,<br /> hair  spray and Nescafé <br /> smell so  strong and familiar<br /> it makes  one wonder if it is morning or night. <br /> In the  yellow bathroom,<br /> the girl  takes her seat facing <br /> the wall  full of  tiles <br /> interlocking  like arms squaring to lift their black centers. <br /> The  mother untwists the rubber band<br /> and a  few strands snap.  </p>  <p>She  leans her belly into the girl's spine.  <br /> Lightly  the amber brush, then<br /> the wide  speckled comb <br /> untangle  the limp brown hair.<br /> The  mother's hands smooth <br /> the  girl's skull, circle it at the crown,<br /> wrap the  red rubber band around the hank <br /> quickly,  perfectly, twice,<br /> as if it  were an entire plant of celery in her hands. <br /> All is  luminous:  approaching blonde.</p>  <p>Every  Saturday the mother's freckled hands <br /> pour  gold over the girl's head;<br /> then the  piercing scent of sliced lemons,<br /> and a  warm water veil <br /> flows  down from a white kitchen cup.  <br /> The sun  slants through the slats of the blinds, <br /> falls on  a thick lemon shell rocking <br /> on its  shiny pocked rind, <br /> its soft  white center slimy and spent.<br /> The  mother reaches for the slim girl<br /> waiting  on the back of the bottle.</p>  <p>She is  my mother in a cotton housedress,<br /> and I am  the freckled eleven year old,<br /> who,  more than <em>anything else</em><br /> wants to  be able to sleep over <br /> an  entire night at a friend's house,<br /> without  waking homesick in the inconsolable night:<br /><em>Will you drive me home now  please?</em><br /> I worry  that my mother is alone there.  <br /> I have  to get back to her.</p>  <p>I  remember the brittle knots <br /> ripped  from the bristles of  those days,  <br /> when  your hands held my head <br /> in the  kitchen sink, my naked back cold and wet,<br /> the  sounds of water pounding,<br /> my head  lumbered <br /> involuntarily,  and looked up at you, <br /> like it  was someone else's head, <br /> maybe  your head,</p>  <p>turning,  as it did years later <br /> from the  front seat of the car, <br /> when you  first saw your grandchild,<br /> part  black, part jew, part you-- <br /> six  years old sitting next to me in the back seat, <br /> her best  dress  tied with a wide blue ribbon.  <br /> She was  waiting to meet you, when, <br /> smiling,  you turned your gray head,<br /> reached  your hand back naturally to touch her, <br /> and that  same hand that washed my hair <br /> recoiled  from her nappy head </p>  <p>like the  snake that lived under the screen porch<br /> of your  childhood where you pumped <br /> the  water into the bucket,<br /> the  screen door slapped hard, twice<br /> and  your younger sisters lined up <br /> at the  farmhouse sink every Saturday.<br /> You tied  on your mother's bleached apron, <br /> and  washed them over and over<br /> head  after head,  girl after girl <br /> in the  same water, careful <br /> not to  waste the rain.</p>
