          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>My writing intersects the  fields of law and literature, with the voices of contemporary women.  <br />
For thirty years I worked  primarily as a lawyer, a judge, a law professor, and writer specializing in the  field of domestic violence reform. I have  a Master’s degree in creative writing form the University of Colorado (1997)  and have won a half dozen writing awards, most recently the 2009 Silver Solas  Women’s Travel Writing Award for the essay, “Meeting the Dalai Lama in Tibet” (<em>The Chrysalis Reader,</em> 2009).  </p>
          <p>My poetry and non-fiction have been published in <em>Ms., The Denver Quarterly, Tumblewords:  Writers Reading the West, Empire Magazine,  The Bloomsbury Review, Disturbing the Peace</em>, <em>Texas Journal on Women and the Law</em>, and <em>Harvard Women’s Law Journal</em>, <em>The  Denver Post.</em>  I co-edited an  anthology, <em>Beyond Portia: Women Law and  Literature in the U.S</em>, published by Northeastern University Press  (1977).   My novel, <em>My Sisters Made of Light</em>, a story set inside Pakistan’s human  rights movement, was published by Press 53 in 2010.  It was a finalist for the Colorado Book Award  in Literary Fiction.  </p>
          <p>I have  won writing awards in nonfiction and in poetry: 2009 Solas Silver Women’s  Travel Writing Award and 1997 Rocky Mountain MLA Essay Award; 2009 TCL Poetry  Contest, 2000 CLEA Creative Writing, 1997 Denver Press Club, 1997 Colorado  Council on the Arts fellowship; 1994 William Battrick Award; 1995 Rocky  Mountain Women’s Institute.  </p>
