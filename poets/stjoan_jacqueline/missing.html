          <h1><a name="_Toc132470731" id="_Toc132470731">Glenn Miller Was Missing</a></h1>
          <p>Glenn  Miller was missing.  Somewhere over the  English Channel, <br />
            his  plane went down in December 1944.  You'd  been drafted, <br />
            even  with a wife and two daughters to support and <br />
            day  work in a defense plant and night work in the clubs, <br />
            your  teeth clamped onto the reed of  a  saxophone,  chin tucked in,<br />
            neck  thrown back under the black and silver clarinet.<br />
            Even  in your tuxedo, you were slated for war.    <br />
            If  Glenn Miller could die, you could die. <br />
            I  don't know what it looked like,  you two  too scared to be <br />
            separated.  They say your bags were packed for months. <br />
            You  had to be ready to go.  Even the birth of  a third child<br />
            couldn't  stop it now. <br />
            <br />
            By  Springtime in Berlin Hitler was dead, or so it was reported.  <br />
            The  war camps were being emptied of some, and filled with others.  <br />
            The  boys were coming home, but no one was sure <br />
            whether  to celebrate or not.  No one knew if you  might still have to go <br />
            or  not.  The war with Japan continued.  Scientists were speeding their experiments.  <br />
            Khaki  uniforms crisscrossing the globe.  Drop  the bomb. <br />
            Alternative  plans on the political front. Pressure from the Allies.  <br />
            Hurry  before they do it first!  Americans were  sick of war.   <br />
            In  August, there were Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and I was born <br />
            forty  days later.  In the hospital my mother  counted all <br />
            my  fingers,  all my toes.   A baby whose father never had to go.  </p>
          <p>It's  as though it was set like a bomb fifty years ago,<br />
            and  now it goes off  when the phone rings and  it's my mother <br />
            calling  to hear my voice and she asks me if I know <br />
            that  she is leaving by air transport.  She  says,<br />
            I'm  leaving for the war, and her 85 year old voice begins to tremble.<br />
            Will  you take care of my children? she begs me,   warning, <br />
            it's  a big job.   She is making these last  requests of me,<br />
            This  woman forever in fear of what the neighbors would say<br />
            this  woman whose  sins I am sick to death of  listing <br />
            and  won't.  I think</p>
          <p>how  brave she is, this warrior, packed for the end, ready to give her all <br />
            for  her country.  So I lie to her, and I tell  her <br />
            of  course I will take care of the children, they are such good girls.  I wish her luck  <br />
            and  thank her for the sacrifice she is making   for us all.  <br />
            I  pray you'll be home by Christmas, I say over the phone,<br />
            and I mean it.   Her voice sounds so sad. I hope so, she whispers. <br />
            I  imagine her head is down, phone at her ear, talking into her breasts, <br />
            loose  now in a loose gown.  And then it is  quiet.<br />
            I  am lost in this when she starts to laugh.<br />
            I've  been sitting here with the other girls, she tells me.  <br />
            Jane  had a date last night.  I just don't know  why Daddy <br />
            hasn't  come to pick me up.  She begins<br />
            talking  about you, </p>
          <p>You  over there on her dresser in the white tuxedo<br />
            with the black bow tie, your wavy hair so  light, <br />
            your  green eyes young in smoky shades of sepia, <br />
            and  folded in the other photo next to you <br />
            As  you two were in the mahogany bed,<br />
            is  this delicate  young dark-eyed woman,<br />
            a  farm girl pretending sophistication, a studio portrait,<br />
            something  taken in the thirties, hinged there forever <br />
            looking  out, not at us, not at each other, you have become<br />
            not  even you, but Youth, so sweet <br />
            So  strange to hear my mother now asking for you, <br />
            when  the last time I saw you, your neck muscles<br />
            were  finally surrendering to the pillow.<br />
            Anita  wrapped your dentures in Kleenex. <br />
            I  tried to tie my silk scarf around your head <br />
            to  keep your slack mouth shut, but the weight was too much <br />
            or  the scarf was too narrow, or my will to force the act was too weak,<br />
            and  we dragged home to tell our mother.  <br />
            We  lied to her that your death had been painless.  <br />
            Now  we conspire again to protect her <br />
            and  I wonder if that's what you did<br />
            when  she says she saw you just the other day and <br />
            you  acted like you didn't even know her.  I  would never <br />
            cheat  on Jimmy, she says to me now, I love him so much, <br />
            but  now I don't know if he loves me.  Why  doesn't he <br />
            come  and get me?  I love him so very much, she  repeats, more and more desperate.  <br />
            So  I tell her you are nearby and she is safe right where<br />
            you  want her to be, and she agrees that it's all for the best.<br />
            She  calls me by her sister's name, lifts her voice, pauses and asks me, <br />
            and  how are the children?  </p>
          <p>One  thing I can't explain is how I feel when people say <br />
            it  must be so hard to see your mother's mind fail, <br />
            when  I feel like finally, finally,<br />
            all  of her places and years come pouring out to me. <br />
            And  I think it is me she tells these things to <br />
            only  because I am here, and because <br />
            when  Glenn Miller was missing and <br />
            she  was afraid of war and so were you,  <br />
            you  comforted her all night long.<br />
            So  that now, nine months and fifty years later <br />
            when  I walk through the door <br />
            with  my trench coat folded over my arm, <br />
            she  looks long into my green eyes, <br />
            and  she thinks I am you.</p>
