  <h1>Singing&nbsp;</h1>  <p>What do I know of  God but that each winter<br /> I thank him for it? No spider webs<br /> snagged in the bluestem, no horseflies at rest<br /> in cones of henbit, no slug trails penned<br /> to the cooled hoods of cars. We are creatures all,<br /> stillborn to the language of split pine rails<br /> standing in their pickets, ice glazed to bone<br /> in every rut, the stealth tracks of jays a sleepless<br /> ideography in the snow. But we are not<br /> entirely alone between the mountain ranges,<br /> in these hours condemned to darkness<br /> before the sun gyres open the face of February<br /> and the red flare of Mars grows dim.<br /> Just outside my door, the burr oak is wintered<br /> full of gracklesâ€” hundreds of coin-<br /> eyed scuttles ornamenting its branches. Here,<br /> my breath plumes gray. In the distance,<br /> brush catches fire. The wind, if you watch,<br /> is calligraphy; the stars in winter,<br /> a weightlessness. The grackles are doors,<br /> rasping their flight plans limb to limb.<br /> The grackles are doors, some limned with light,<br /> others black. Rising, my arms have long<br /> been open. Stepping across these thresholds,<br /> I step across these thresholds. Singing, I sing.</p>  <p>(<em>Ascent</em>,  Winter 2012)</p>
