  <h1>Ghost Gear</h1>  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low  tide, my father highsteps the trammel net, stoops<br /> half-submerged in Tanaga Bay and begins the work<br /> of disentangling another sockeye from the interlaced snares.<br />&nbsp;<br /> He stands before me now, the same foot shorter<br /> he&rsquo;s been the last ten years, my sister and I<br /> nothing back then but a notion<br /> when my father could hold his breath<br /><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br />  </em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well  over a minute</em>,<br />&nbsp;<br /> how or why I&rsquo;ve learned not to ask, the familiar arc of his story<br /> cast out like he, the newest member of the crew,<br /> flung to the farthest edge of the intertidal.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  could hear better then</em>, he adds.<br />&nbsp;<br /> Good thing. Otherwise,<br /> he&rsquo;d not have heard that thin cry of alarum from the beach. Otherwise,<br /> he&rsquo;d not have looked up from his work<br />&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to  see the bellowing cord of the continental shelf<br /> rise to obscure summer&rsquo;s first dusk as if Britomartis herself,<br /> goddess of fishermen, has half-risen from the sea<br /> to encompass that final island of the Aleutians.<br />&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumbstruck,  my father watches the wave suck in the tide<br /> like a maw: his legs, Wranglers rolled to the knee,<br /> for the first time exposed, the net an organism in and of itself,<br /> a bare root system, salmon left clapping wet sand<br /> as far as the eye could see—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wave the  width of his vision charging the land.<br />&nbsp;<br /> My father claims that in such moments,<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  body lightens.</em><em><br /></em>&nbsp;<br /> My father claims that there, he saw himself<br /> bird&rsquo;s-eye-view, that he watched himself look up at the sky<br /> and the sky had become a mirror.<br />&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  he sees his body ascend the cumulus<br /> as if pulled by threads of light, each thrust of the sky&rsquo;s wide wings<br /> lifting him ever closer to a rift in the clouds.<br />&nbsp;<br /> But my father does not kneel genuflect to the gods,<br /> he does not consider his sins or ask for forgiveness. Rather,<br /> he gives his marrow to those ropes;<br /> he weaves himself into those moorings.<br />&nbsp;<br /> And the last thing he sees is the wave.<br /> And the last thing he hears is something like the clap of a thousand hands.<br />&nbsp;<br /> And the sea took him.<br />&nbsp;<br /> Language fails my father here, so he resorts to sound:<br /><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br />  </em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wham!</em><em><br /></em>&nbsp;<br /> slamming one open palm into the other as if to quash<br /> something living, his posture surging in our living room—<br /> the tumblings of his cliffhanger—<br /> body whipped by the imagined sea.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How  do I describe what seemed like hours beneath the waves?</em><em><br /></em><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em>I  am a poet retelling a telling.<br />&nbsp;<br /> The sea did not care about my father,<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But</em><em><br /></em>&nbsp;<br /> the wave came and went and my father<br /> held his ground, the backdraft strong in the wave&rsquo;s wake—<br /> Britomartis&rsquo; final tug for his spirit.<br />&nbsp;<br /> And he lashed the flesh of his life from that ocean.<br />&nbsp;<br /> And the water receded.<br />&nbsp;<br /> Now, my father lights up when he tells how he returned to the beach<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as  slowly as possible</em><br /> and how, when the  men saw him emerge from the sea,<br /> they cheered his name, my father returned<br /> from what they believed to be the dead:<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost  gear, they call it:</em><em><br /></em><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em>nets and riggings lost at sea to fish for no man.<br /> Blindly trolling seines illuminating the deep<br /> with their bioluminescent catch.<br /> Ruptured buoys and trammels coasting past coral reefs<br /> until they drift down<em>,</em><em><br /></em><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br />  </em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down  into the dark.</em><em><br /></em>&nbsp;<br /> Only once have I asked my father<br /> why he chose out there to live. And only once<br /> has he told me that as the wave approached,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he heard a voice.<br />&nbsp;<br /> And that voice asked him,<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are  you a father?</em><em><br /></em>&nbsp;<br /> And my father replied,<br /><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</em></p>  <p>(<em>Copper Nickel</em>, Fall 2012) </p>
