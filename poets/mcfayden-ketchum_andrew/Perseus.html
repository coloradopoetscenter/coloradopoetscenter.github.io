  <h1>Perseus </h1>  <p>No words for that which holds him here so silent:<br /> mortal on this limestone bluff, wet leaves dead <br /> beneath wet snow and day&rsquo;s last light scouring <br />  the west face of the ridge. Last night, </p>  <p>it was the comet he eyed through the lens: elusive, <br /> walleyed luminance swelled between the crosshairs. Now, <br /> late dusk, it&rsquo;s an answer he seeks of the upcountry, <br /> of its rivers carved long ago by glaciers. Now, </p>  <p>it&rsquo;s an answer he seeks of this stunned earth, of this <br /> stunned body— body bound to nickel, body bound <br /> to iron— body bound by the selfsame forces <br /> that fix Perseus in the high north sky. But he doubts </p>  <p>he&rsquo;s as alone as this arrangement of stars, the screech <br /> owl&rsquo;s wail descending through the night, the bobcat&rsquo;s cry <br /> to the sun-<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a>turned-moon— all of us with  this need </p>  <p>for some belief, with this need for some faith. <br /> That someplace deep: a fire-blazoned core. That someplace <br /> not far: an ear for such lost and lonely music.</p>  <p>(for Judy Jordan)<br /> (<em>Bellingham Review, </em>Spring 2013)</p>
