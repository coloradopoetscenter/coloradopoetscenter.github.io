  <h1>Trying</h1>  <blockquote>  <p><em>Beauty will  be convulsive or not at all.</em><br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– André Breton</p>  </blockquote>  <p>Today,  gratitude has been difficult.<br /> <br /> The lightness&nbsp;of this week's sleep<br /> like a body inside my body<br />  suddenly limp, tired of trying.</p>  <p>Last  night, my brain&nbsp;shot straight up<br /> like a child at bedtime,&nbsp;begging:<br /><br /><em>One  more story. One more song. </em></p>  <p>And  now, a new night approaching,<br /> the forecast for snow and no one&nbsp;ever knows<br /> how much. But I'm&nbsp;a sucker for surprises:</p>  <p>Like  the lake this morning, the old Hays Lake,<br /> <br /> to  my left&nbsp;for the lingering mile. How, today,<br /> it made&nbsp;such a grand show of silence,<br /> impossible glints all along its surface.</p>  <p>This  is what I want when I say <em>beauty</em>, <br /> I  mean <em>persistence</em>: these reversals we  endure—</p>  <p>a  hurried blur of clouds closing in. </p>  <p>(Originally  published in <em>Northwind</em>) </p>
