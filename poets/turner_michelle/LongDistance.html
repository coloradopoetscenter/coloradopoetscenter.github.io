  <h1>Long Distance Call </h1>  <p><br /> And lately, doorways <br /> make me flinch. Also<br /> calendars and books without  creases.<br />  Completely reasonable, but</p>  <p>when a wasp found my finger <br /> on the walk home, I said,  fine, <br /> clutching the swell of pain <br /> as if it were a prize.  <br /> <br /> I saw it coming. When I was  young,<br /> one stung me in the eye, my  mother<br /> peering over me like a  flashlight.  </p>  <p>I know, it&rsquo;s obvious: the new  fear<br /> of thresholds, the old need  to predict.</p>  <p>When the first snow hits, the  whirling<br /> white notes are always too  much for me. <br /> If I were braver, I&rsquo;d fill my  arms<br /> with winter and carry it  home.</p>  <p>Some mornings, abandoned  shoes<br /> hang from telephone wires.<br /> Why do people throw them  there? </p>  <p>I want to wear them or toss  my own<br /> so someone, later, waiting  for a bus<br /> will watch them wobbling, </p>  <p>the weathered buildings behind  them, <br /> the weakly-lit sky,  blackening leaves  <br /> stuck to the laces and  loosening. </p>  <p>But to deserve such a thing.<br /> To want such a thing at all. </p>  <p>(Originally published in <em>Meridian</em>) </p>
