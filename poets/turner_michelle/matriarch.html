          <h1>Matriarch, Age Seven          </h1>
          <p><br />
            Exploring her mother&rsquo;s jewelry  drawer,<br />
          she counts and sorts the  chains,</p>
          <p>their cold weight against her  skin. </p>
          <p>From the kitchen, the clatter  of glasses <br />
            and dishes, her mother&rsquo;s  voice,</p>
          <p>the pressure of the rushing  faucet. </p>
          <p>The sound of only water is  her father,<br />
            his hushed anger, his  palm  </p>
          <p>flat against the  counter.  </p>
          <p>She follows their  conversation <br />
            without the words, leans into  the mirror.</p>
          <p>She imagines her lips wide  and powerful.</p>
          <p>Outside the window,<br />
            one hundred birds in her own  yard.  </p>
          <p>Dizzy with visions, she  wanders into the hall,</p>
          <p>pauses at the top of the  stairs.<br />
            Grief has worn hard </p>
          <p>the paths of these carpets. </p>
          <p>Everywhere in the house<br />
            she feels it, though the  majesty of emotion </p>
          <p>she interprets as love.          </p>
