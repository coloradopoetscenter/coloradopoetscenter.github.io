  <h1>March Equinox </h1>  <p><br />  The long finger of winter  wags in the afternoon, says <em>so what</em>, says <em>get up</em>.Â  </p>  <p>No wonder I must take the  steep path through the too cold, <br /> the package of my body  loosely wrapped and rattling like an unfit gift. </p>  <p>I&rsquo;ll hike to the top of my  town.</p>  <p>Feel for myself the thaw,  earn for myself the proud sticker <br /> of a new season, and believe in  it: the sun, faithfully ablaze</p>  <p>as it crosses an imaginary  line. The bitterness unraveling, <br /> I am my own best offering. It  lasts but a moment. Call it a minute. </p>  <p>(Originally published in <em>Poet Lore</em>) </p>
