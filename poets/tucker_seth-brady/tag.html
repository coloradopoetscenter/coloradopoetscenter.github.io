<ul><li><a href="http://www.coloradopoetscenter.org/eWords/issue23/SethBradyTucker.html">Colorado Poet Interview</a></li></ul>  <h1>Tag</h1>  <p>In a city such as this, you steal Kenwood<br /> and Harmon-Kardon stereos from row houses <br /> and from the dashboards of badass tinted <br />  and chromed and lowered hydraulic-injected </p>  <p>turbo rides with even bigger and more badass <br /> owners and dealers and pimps and embezzlers <br /> who all sport hate tattoos on their elbows<br /> or ears or necks or calves or privates or scalps.  </p>  <p>So you steal to get the slick acrylic paint <br /> you need to spill your colors and your messages<br /> on the rail cars.  The  security guards at the rail <br /> yards have guns, so you have made your own </p>  <p>invention to attach to the spray cans—a silencer <br /> made of cardboard tp rolls, duct tape, and a plastic <br /> bucket with a hole cut in the bottom.  You tag <br /> with the hard acrylic so that the epistles you send </p>  <p>out to small towns like Flagstaff and Santa Fe <br /> and Barstow and Huntsville and Tallahassee can <br /> be seen for what they are:a shout out into the void <br /> of America, a note in a bottle that rattles on hot rails, </p>  <p>and you hope deep down that someone will see your words,<br /> that they will travel the hard track back into the wild  night, <br /> that for once someone will come looking for you without <br /> punishment or violence or retribution on their minds, </p>  <p>and when they arrive, accompanied by the deep echoed wail <br /> of the rail cars and the hot dark breath of swirling prairie  dreams, <br /> you hope they will finally carry the message that saves you.</p>  <p>(<em>Atlanta Review)</em></p>
