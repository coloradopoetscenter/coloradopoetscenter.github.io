  <h1>The  Road to Baghdad </h1>  <p>Is less a road than a floral <br /> collection of spongy and soft<br />  bodies, a gathering of the myriad</p>  <p>colors of nations—burnt umber,<br /> puce, kiln red, olive drab, hot<br /> steel.  It is a road  that stretches</p>  <p>eternally into the ochre mocha <br /> of the horizon.  The  road <br /> to Baghdad has its own atmosphere</p>  <p>and sound, so unlike the roads <br /> I have driven in the States—here,<br /> the road is silent but for the pops</p>  <p>and spits of flame where trucks<br /> clutch the bright and colorful<br /> bodies of the unfortunate dead.</p>  <p>The road to Baghdad is like the aftermath<br /> of a Fourth of July parade—streets <br /> littered with the chaos of celebration,</p>  <p>where dyed paper and the bright <br /> hulls of fireworks gather in the gutter.<br /> Sometimes, I look for the road </p>  <p>to Baghdad in old maps or on <br /> the web, but I can never find<br /> it—the distance of time has cleared</p>  <p>it from the record books, has erased<br /> it from everywhere but my mind, and <br /> from the minds of those soldiers who saw</p>  <p>it with me.  Today, I  awake in the morning <br /> with unexplained scratches on the bridge <br /> of my nose, and I ask my empty room, where </p>  <p>has that road gone?  I  understand that if there <br /> is no road, then there is no me.  But if none <br /> of this ever really happened, how do I awaken </p>  <p>every morning to the sun burning my outline<br /> into the wild asphalt of that beautiful highway?</p>  <p>(<em>Shine</em>)</p>
