          <h1>Watermelon Truck Near Araby,  Georgia</h1>
          <p>Seth Brady Tucker<strong></strong></p>
          <p>The work of two  hundred days is littered on the burning roadside<br />
          like broken skulls  and seeping brains.  A single crop of  watermelons </p>
          <p>burst and leaking  along the highway like hungry pulped mouths<br />
            open and gaping in  the hundred degree sun.  My boy and I are  unhurt; </p>
          <p>a miraculous  escape from a crushed rental semi.  There  was no hint<br />
            of danger, no sign  of trouble—only one single lovely melon tumbling </p>
          <p>and breaking in my  rearview mirror—a slow motion acrobat spinning <br />
            innards and seeds  from a pin-wheeling fruit body.  Then our  truck </p>
          <p>was sideways and  flipping with the same urgency, our bodies spastic<br />
            and loose in the  cab like holiday popcorn on a cast-iron stove.  </p>
          <p>The sound of  tearing metal and busting gourds is the sound of a train <br />
            running over  rabbits.  For a moment I mistake the wet  and thin pink </p>
          <p>blood running  along the floorboards as my own, or worse, my young <br />
            son&rsquo;s.  I reach for him and feel the cool sweet juice  of my watermelon </p>
          <p>crop upon his sun  darkened skin.  For the moment,  everything is all right.  <br />
            Behind us my  wrecked crop stretches in hot agony--an entire summer </p>
          <p>of work gone in  five seconds, now a three hundred yard syrupy smear on I-75.<br />
            We wait for help  for nearly thirty minutes.  White faces  drive slowly by, </p>
          <p>crushing the fruit  of my labor beneath tires anointed with one tear <br />
            and a pound of  sweat for each ripe melon destroyed. Their eyes see </p>
          <p>only an accident  on a highway, but it is more than that—this is the destruction<br />
            of a family and a  name.  It is a bloodline running its  course, a year&rsquo;s wages </p>
          <p>wasted to a  blazing highway.  We are lost, surrounded  here by dark forest <br />
            and bright asphalt  which, given the power of speech, still wouldn&rsquo;t utter</p>
          <p>any kind  word.  This is a tale of blood, thin and  watery and pulled from <br />
            a thousand empty  generations.  My father would tell me  that these are loses </p>
          <p>only faith can  redeem, and I stand with my empty hands tucked hard <br />
            into my trousers,  forsaken, and watch my beautiful son begin to skip rope </p>
          <p>over the fleshy  rinds with a length of frayed baling string.  <br />
            Like he doesn&rsquo;t  have a care in the whole wide world.          </p>
          <p>(<em>River Styx</em>)</p>
