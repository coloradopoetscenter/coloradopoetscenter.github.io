<h1> Einstein&rsquo;s Parrot</h1>
<p> Sometimes reasons are hard to come by, </p>
<p> especially at 75. Look at Albert. </p>
<p> He arrives, scudding across Lake Carnegie </p>
<p> in his primitive skiff, </p>
<p> shouldering the oddest of his birthday gifts, </p>
<p> a mute and despondent parrot he calls Bibo. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> I admire, he tells us, the rhythm of it </p>
<p> like scattering crystals or old Hungarian canticles. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> He attempts to cheer it with bad jokes and happy piano blues. </p>
<p> Bibo, hopeless as a mitten in a moth hatchery, </p>
<p> holds his tongue, his theories on syntax </p>
<p> and the vernacular of alienation peculiar and private. </p>
<p> Should he ask for bread, Albert will give him cake. </p>
<p> Bibo wishes they would all think a little less and get on with it. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
