<h1>Skin Boat
</h1>
<p>This last day facing West, </p>
<p>muzzy-headed with autumn, </p>
<p>circadian clocks skewed, </p>
<p>we amble miles of Vendeen trails near Dunquin </p>
<p>and all along Slea Head, taking in viridian outlines</p>
<p>of five mounded Blaskets socked in and unreachable.</p>
<p>Streamlined gannets, dozens of them, </p>
<p>soar and plunge the towering skelligs </p>
<p>while Angelus bells toll an elongated noon Sanctus.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Spotting a beached row of upended curraghs, </p>
<p>their unkeeled carcasses tightening in the sun,</p>
<p>we fasten our hands tentatively across one of them</p>
<p>its hazel lath and wicker hull lashed diagonal,</p>
<p>canvas bias stitched and black with tar,</p>
<p>frame cobbled like ours from oddments and leavings,</p>
<p>woven and weighted against rock and barnacle:</p>
<p>fashioned from what we now know </p>
<p>is hard won in faithless times.</p>
