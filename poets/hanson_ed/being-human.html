<h1>On Being Human</h1>
<p>Each morning<br />as thin weightless fingers<br />of sunlight slip through shades<br />slide stealthily into reviving<br />barely conscious mind<br />flick away the scales of sleep<br />we emerge to a whole new world<br />recreated overnight<br />  by time and shifted perspective</p>
<p>All that went before<br />is merely history<br />all that stands ahead<br />is vulnerable to new solutions<br />fresh points of view<br />  that did not exist yesterday</p>
<p>Each day we face the task<br />to renew our commitment<br />to see ourselves succeed<br />through one more day<br />to establish our lives<br />as more than just a ride<br />on fortune's ebb and flow<br />to embrace that one quality<br />that is specially and uniquely ours<br />  </p>
