              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>I was born in Pomona, California September 28, 1950, and grew up in Chino, a few miles away. I graduated from Chino High    School in 1968. At the age of three, I was struck  with polio. With the help of intense physical therapy and lots of support, I  was left with no physical damage.</p>
              <p>I attended Chaffey   Community College &amp;  received an A.S. in Geology in 1970. During my time at Chaffey, I began to  visit the local mountains and desert, falling in love with them. I spent a lot  of time hiking and rock collecting.</p>
              <p>In 1975, I took my first job as a chemical lab technician  and worked in the field of Analytical Chemistry for the next 23 years,  analyzing coal products, gold &amp; silver ores, specialty gas mixtures,  environmental water samples, and finally, generic pharmaceuticals.</p>
              <p>I married in 1980 and moved to Phelan, near Victorville,  in the Mojave Desert, where we set up a small  mobile home with a wind generator, solar electric panels, a generator, a wood  stove, and a propane refrigerator. We had water delivered to the property and  stored it in a 1000 gallon galvanized tank. We lived a mile off the paved road.</p>
              <p>My daughter Terra was born in 1986. By that time, our  property was serviced by power &amp; telephone lines, and a water main.</p>
              <p>I returned to school in 1984 and received an A.S. in  Computer Science from Victor Valley College,  Victorville, CA in 1987. I continued at Cal State San  Bernardino for two semesters until my wife&rsquo;s health began to deteriorate and I  had to quit.</p>
              <p>We moved to Denver  in 1991 due to my wife&rsquo;s health. In 1992 we separated and <br />
                in 1995, we divorced.</p>
              <p>At the age of 42, as I began to find and re-read pieces I  had stashed in different places over the years, I realized I had always been a  writer and I began writing seriously, producing poetry, song lyrics, essays,  and articles. In 1998, I began a new career as a technical writer contracting. </p>
