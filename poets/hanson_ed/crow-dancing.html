<h1>Crow Dancing</h1>
<p>Tonight the wind sings<br />in pine tree high branches<br />along the mountainsides<br />that flank the moon flashing<br />  waters of the wide creek</p>
<p>Tonight the old medicine woman<br />sings along with the piney wind<br />counterpoint to coyote&rsquo;s croon<br />while crow dances on a tree stump<br />  watches her from across the fire</p>
<p>Tonight the bright moon melts<br />into a silver haze<br />smeared across the western sky<br />fading to black <br />  as night folds into mystery </p>
<p>Coyote and crow<br />mountains and trees and the wide creek<br />old medicine woman and her song<br />all become memories <br />  carried on the night wind</p>
