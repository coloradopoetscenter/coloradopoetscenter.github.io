<h1>Hands</h1>
<p>The gift of hands was given<br />to carry out the work<br />  of the great unseen Source</p>
<p>With this gift we carry out<br />the most evil atrocities<br />while claiming to be<br />agents of that source<br />defenders of that source<br />upholders of the law of that source<br />  which we ourselves define</p>
<p>For the pain we have caused<br />we should be taken to the square<br />in front of all the world<br />dragged, by the hair, if necessary<br />to the executioner&rsquo;s block<br />  and have our hands cut off</p>
