<h1>Silver Tip</h1>
<p>Places you know<br />turquoise behind silver-tipped peaks<br />strung around the neck<br />of a Navajo grandmother<br />against the stormy peace<br />  of her wrinkled copper skin</p>
<p>Seen from the highway<br />seen in a magazine<br />seen next to a Hogan<br />weaving sheep&rsquo;s wool<br />into a legacy<br />  weaving legend into history</p>
<p>Glacier tipped mountains<br />painted in the distance<br />shimmering turquoise vault of sky<br />rain shaft stalking the horizon<br />seen along the roadside<br />  places you know</p>
<p>Places you&rsquo;ve seen<br />sacred mountains in the distance<br />places you have never been<br />places you are called to go<br />  </p>
