<ul><li><a href="http://www.coloradopoetscenter.org/eWords/issue16/melendez.html">Colorado Poet Interview</a></li></ul>  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>Maria Melendez is a wildly original poet whose monster goddesses and monster energies<br /> make you believe that poetry might indeed save the earth.<br />  --Sandra Alcosser</p>  <p>Flexible Bones is bold, far-ranging in its content, and inspired by las musas. The voice<br /> is of the woman is sure and strong, consistent in every poem...the strong presence and<br /> guidance of the goddesses, Coatlicue and la Virgen de Guadalupe, is felt in every line,<br /> in every commitment the poems make. Poems made of carne y hueso y un niervito en el<br /> pequeso como dice la gente, flexible but strong, bone density strong. A blessing.<br /> --Rudolfo Anaya</p>  <p>Intrepid—Maria Melendez’s art is as intrepid and her voice as upbeat as one can find in<br /> today’s poetry. Her poems read like double exposures—politics and pastures, spirit world<br /> and irreverence, erotic protest as well as ‘nutrient love.’ How Long She’ll Last in This<br /> World is a world created from the open eyes and ears of a marvelously original poet.<br /> --Sandra McPherson</p>  <p>I don’t know anyone writing like Maria Melendez, and keeping so many pearls in the air.<br /> Her work is not just new, it’s weirdly instructive, subtly subversive and very bold.<br /> --Gary Snyder</p>
