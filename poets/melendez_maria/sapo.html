  <h1>Sapo Dorado—A Recent Extinction</h1>  <p>One thousand day-glo toads appeared in a handful of muddy seeps<br /> that spring, los machos stretching their tiny orange suits<br /> in a clamber to get at las hembras, who lay like glistening yellow<br /> buddhas of the mud. No one knew the toad count from all<br /> the Monteverde mountain-puddles together, but you just missed them.<br /> A few years back, a couple cloud-forest kilometers higher,<br /> you almost could've touched them. They were just here.<br /> Back through a little drizzle and fizz of time, you'll find a writhing &quot;toad ball,&quot; ten<br /> males throwing their two-inch selves all over<br /> a female's softball-sized back, slapping and shoving each other,<br /> wanting to live, as much as they want the next guy<br /> to get nailed by a bird. Don't be fooled by the females'<br /> sanguine refusal to rouse themselves, their sedentary meditation<br /> amidst the frenzy. They want to live, too. They spool this want<br /> through their perfect insides, globe it to tan and black pearls,<br /> sphere it out to the fates. They've made enough spawn,<br /> so their natural histories say, for each clutch to withstand<br /> depredation and still live on. Squirt-and-go parenting's<br /> no less urgent than what passes, in our case, for nurture, mind you—<br /> if the Maker had ordained teacher conferencing and soccer game<br /> snack rotations for Bufo species, they'd carefully mark<br /> calendars, insist their little ones practice goal-kicks,<br /> and they'd read aloud twenty minutes each night to support<br /> the tadpoles' fluency. But such is not their strategy.<br /> After a blazing crossfire of the sexes, the golden toads<br /> plowed back into mud. The next green season eleven<br /> came out, the year after, only one. Stretch your fingers into<br />  the drifting mist and you'll almost touch him, the last</p>  <p>sapo dorado, spotted a little ways higher, a year or two back.<br /> (Sugar House Review; Poetry Daily)</p>
