  <h1>Semillas</h1>  <p>I'm planting darkness in him,<br /> I used to say, of my son.<br /> I used to see myself thumbing<br /> hard little seeds of displeasure<br /> into his ready soil.<br /> What was so unright about him?<br /> We watch &quot;August Rush&quot; together,<br /> and I want to say: I would look<br /> for you ever, in each note of all<br /> crowded symphonies, I would be<br /> twisting my head at the cant<br /> of desperation to find you.<br /> But he is not lost, he is here<br /> to me, near enough so that<br /> when he heaves off the docking<br /> couch, I go to hug him and joke, &quot;Are you my son? It looks like<br /> I've found you! Are you my<br /> boy?&quot; And he torques<br /> a crooked smile, eyes lit<br /> with pleasure at being attended,<br /> embarrassed by my sudden<br /> shift out of crabdom.<br /> He half-chuckles, &quot;Yeah. I<br /> guess so.&quot; Grandparents blessed<br /> me this morning, eight or<br /> nine in a circle at the free<br /> Tai Chi class. They scattered<br /> droplets of outrageous love,<br /> naming new wee ones,<br /> recording who's visiting, when.<br /> I want to express something distinct<br /> from &quot;Have you finished&quot; and &quot;Will you do,&quot; and &quot;Stop that&quot;<br /> tonight. I will look at his head<br />  bowed to chewing and bless him,</p>  <p>I will let his life, the whole of it,<br /> be the mineral joy I absorb into my system.</p>  <p>(Final Note)</p>
