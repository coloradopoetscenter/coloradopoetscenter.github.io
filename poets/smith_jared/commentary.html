<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>

<p>&quot;I  like your I-witness of the Song in our blood...it's a pleasure.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Lawrence Ferlinghetti</p>
<p>&quot;...utterly  original and as solid an any poetry that's being written today. It has a firm  grasp of form, it has its own unique music in line after line of low-key  symbolist imagery, and it is also austerely disrespectful of all the right  things. I like this poetry a lot.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --William Packard</p>
<p>&quot;There  is a kind of certainty that seems to characterize Jared Smith's best work, an  understanding about place and the flow of spirit that makes you think of  Thoreau along with a commitment as fierce as that of Pablo Neruda.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Joseph Bruchac</p>
<p>&quot;Again  and again, Jared Smith takes us into a world that we feel is strange and  impossible, only to make us see, suddenly, that this IS our life, our  condition, and until now we have been shying away from reality. Years ago, on  my author-interview show on NPR, I hailed Jared as 'the most important new  voice in American poetry since Walt Whitman.'&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Walter James Miller</p>
<p>&quot;He  is a master of interplay between sensuous detail and the universal,  illuminating the facets of our electric civilization and evoking the earth from  which it rose. Esthetically, discerning readers will see his spiritual kinship  to C.K. Williams and compare his work favorably.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Harry Smith</p>
<p>&quot;There  is a lovely muscularity pervading Jared Smith's work that's reminiscent of the  more obvious long-lined poets' efforts, Whitman's and C.K. William's, for  example. But Smith's poetry is unique in that he seems unlike these other two  writers, not to think in terms of an &quot;overflowing line&quot; but to peer,  consistently, beyond it. What this means is that while Whitman's long lines are  incantatory and Williams' are loquacious in a relaxed, double-hexameter sort of  way, Smith's work, much like an Action Painter's, serves the ambition of the  gesture and thus, of necessity, stretches beyond the canvas.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Terri Brown-Davidson</p>
<p>&quot;For  Smith, there is a kind of pathos in human attempts to replicate the  unfathomable beauty of a mountain or a star-filled sky, a pathos, which is  worthy of regret, even mocking, but never rage, scorn, or absolute despair.  Though his tone could not be called gentle, it is sympathetic to the human  condition and the futility, frustration, sorrow, and bewilderment that  accompany it. This sympathy elevates his poetry to the levels of the masters  who have influenced him&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Joselle Vanderhooft</p>
<p>&quot;Jared  Smith's work deals with the Here and Now, yes, but is so involved with  All-Time/All-Culture that, if you don't keep totally focused, at times you're  liable to step over the connections. Smith is a kind of  Cro-Magnon-Neanderthal-Indus Valley-Mesopotamian-Tiawanaku Combo-Man watching  the late news, buzzarding over the contemporary world and seeing its miserable  negativity&hellip;but ultimately always referring back to the basic sanity of the  universe around us. Sane Nature versus Idiot Man. There is a tremendous  Keatsian-Whitmanesque visionary sweep here, moving over the earth's surface,  always concentrating on light, the Here and Now, but always in cosmic context.  Smith's work, carefully read and meditated on, is a course in cosmic-personal  sanity.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Hugh Fox</p>
<p>&quot;Jared  Smith's voice and hypnotic technique create a vivid world in which images and  ideas appear as easily as in a dream. His poems have a sense of urgency and  purpose. We face the modern world, from nanotechnology to the darkness between  trees, with an intelligent, observant and visionary guide. He seems to name  every nameable thing with an unnamable energy that helps define who we are in  our world. This is what poetry is about! His poems are imaginative, passionate,  personal and expansive.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Michael Spring</p>
<p>&quot;Jared  Smith is an excellent poet; who has learned to live and believe with conviction  that the entire world belongs in and of poetry, not just pieces and bits like  nature poetry, dramatic stories or the demands of friendship and love.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Andrew Glaze</p>
