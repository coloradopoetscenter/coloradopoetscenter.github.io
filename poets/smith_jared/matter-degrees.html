              <h1>A Matter of Degrees</h1>
              <p>Imagine a society of star-gazers<br />
who know only that the lights in the sky are round<br />
and that year after year and generation after generation<br />
those spheres pull the seasons into place behind them<br />
while grain grows in rows that reach up toward them;<br />
they would see these as spherical as opposed <br />
to that which is linear and finite<br />
and dies;<br />
and the wise among them say <br />
it is the edges of these spheres that are important<br />
because it is the edges that always come back upon  themselves<br />
and the seasons change greatly in their progression<br />
but the edges change little through age;<br />
it is those little changes that change all things.<br />
And the wise then study the edges of the spheres,<br />
and they stand with their backs to each other<br />
scanning the horizon in areas where there is no grain,<br />
finding that each step gives them a different unit to view,<br />
and pivoting slowly three hundred sixty steps<br />
inch by inch circuitously to find degrees of perception.</p>
              <p>These star-gazers in their sheepskin coats<br />
                will grab at anything to remember.&nbsp; They will hammer rocks into pillars.<br />
                They will dig holes in the earth to melt down metal.<br />
                They will rip the skin of wild animals.<br />
                All to note down a system of 360 degrees that reaches out<br />
                toward those distant lights that control the warm spring  rain.<br />
                Perhaps they will give degrees to each other.<br />
                They will study units until it is time to pass those units  to another generation.<br />
          It too will go around in carefully measured steps.</p>
              <p>Each unit will become a sphere<br />
                and each unit around that sphere will be another sphere.<br />
                The counting of 360s will be the counting of one.<br />
                Imagine that they build so many towers to reach out toward  that one<br />
                that the earth becomes blanketed with metal walls and plate  glass views of clouds.<br />
                Imagine then that they begin to hurl those towers themselves  upward<br />
                forgetting that there is no upward in a sphere within a sphere<br />
                and that the stars are not indeed above them<br />
                but are in their very bones<br />
          back beyond time.</p>
