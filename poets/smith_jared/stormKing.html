<h1>Storm King Mountain</h1>
<p>Chewing on a stalk of jimson weed,<br />
looking down from Storm King Mountain<br />
where the river flowed its columns of autumn colors,<br />
Pete and I would toss small bits of granite like  paperweights<br />
out over the trees and listen to see if we could hear them  coming back.<br />
Once in awhile we did hear a distant clink<br />
like the meshings of a gear coming into place;<br />
a squirrel&rsquo;s bright eye would leap from our fingers,<br />
a barge of rusting iron would swirl about and pause on the  river below.<br />
It would be a dingy red square upon a blue ribbon<br />
far removed from the sun igniting our valley.<br />
Something dark is coming this way, he said.<br />
I nodded, but what is a man to do.</p>
<p>There was a military academy below us.<br />There was Vietnam.&nbsp; There were heart attacks.<br />There were clocks with metal tongues counting our days.<br />There were gray faced women with gay lit bows<br />wrought in foreign shops by lives long locked away.<br />And the sun was beating down upon us,<br />so that we shed our shirts and began to burn;<br />Would it be so bad, we thought,<br />if something dark were coming this way,<br />when we could see it all so very well.<br />We have the time to plan;<br />we have a vista spread about us.<br />  We can feel the roots of the earth taking hold.</p>
<p>We looked to the sunsets and waves of grain to our west;<br />even there along the marsh drawn margins of the river<br />where mallards and mergansers nest and long legged egrets<br />stretch between two cosmologies to pull coins from the  waters<br />while wild rice rises into evenings catching fire along its  flaring tips.<br />Deer fill the dreams of our suburban alleyways,<br />always moving, shifting shadows at the edge of sight,<br />and wild maidens clasp them to their hearts, run bare-legged<br />into thickets of desire we cannot understand but will come  to cope with.<br />Why would it be hard with all these flames of life<br />swaying with the waves of autumn and a rising sun:<br />  If something dark were to come this way, it would be filled  with light.</p>
<p>In time, a shirt turns into a thousand pounds of metal at 80  miles per hour.<br />It turns into thirty tons of metal at 100 miles per hour.<br />It turns into a factory of crushed stone where life sweats  into the cellar seeps. <br />It turns into a lair built of fallen trees, wrought iron,  and electric needles.<br />It becomes a game of rock-paper-scissors<br />where somehow the paper shears off mountainsides and cuts  metal.<br />Shadows come crashing through our windowpanes<br />to take small pills at night from bedside tables;<br />and, yes, an older man needs to sleep sometimes while the  world keeps up.<br />And, yes, I can sleep, and can still keep it up as well as  any man:<br />Even when something dark is coming toward us I am eager to  pump light into it.<br />There is nothing gentle in a big black box barreling down a  concrete river,<br />though its heart and soul and every shadow within its bulk  is filled<br />with grains of the earth that could feed an endless  multitude.<br />Not with the sun&rsquo;s rays igniting all it touches at 100 miles  per hour<br />  contained within the dark.</p>
