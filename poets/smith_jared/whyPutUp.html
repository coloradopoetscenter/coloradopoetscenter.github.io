<h1>Why Put Up With This Anymore?</h1>
<p>Whether it is by spoken words or written ones,<br />men cannot bring a people together to extract wealth from  what is natural,<br />men cannot pull iron or gold from the darkness that is  earth,<br />men cannot shape steel to climb into the sky on cocktail  wings,<br />men cannot herd men and girls into concrete towers<br />where nothing grows except their love for each other,<br />men cannot grow corn or wheat or marijuana or cocaine,<br />men cannot turn water or fossil fuel to the fiery  entertainment of electricity,<br />men cannot carry their ill-gotten produce from one town into  another,<br />men cannot plant seeds with any expectation of what they  will become,<br />men cannot drive down a highway with no car and no hard  surface,<br />men cannot remember where they are going or that they are  alone or not,<br />men cannot lead invincible armies with evolving weapons,<br />men cannot even feed themselves or their wives or children<br />without fluttering your lungs and your lips together<br />and without your fingers trembling on the edge of something  great<br />and without growing up among others who likewise shape their  lips around air,<br />telling stories that decide who will be the most inclusive  mover of words,<br />whether journalists, engineers, generals, singers,  politicians, or presidents,<br />there are ultimately no others who can come before you<br />whether it is by spoken words or written ones, Poet,<br />I cannot understand why you hang your head down<br />  and skulk in alleys eating poverty with your words.</p>
<p>--Jared Smith, from <strong>Where Images  Become Imbued With Time</strong>, 2007</p>
