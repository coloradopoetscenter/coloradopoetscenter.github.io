              <h1>Getting Ready to Move On</h1>
              <p>The  last flowers blaze their dry color<br />
like  Easter baskets left outside all year into the first freeze of autumn,<br />
their  reds and oranges flaming from dry frost-bit stalks.<br />
This  is the last day after sixteen years we will tend them.<br />
In  the spring rains, a new enormous house of fieldstone<br />
will  fill this garden with its family of four and three car garage.<br />
This  is the garden that glowed the golden color of my wife&rsquo;s hair,<br />
gone  cold now with memory and the need to be elsewhere.</p>
              <p>We  will not be here,<br />
                having  followed the leaves in their last ecstasy,<br />
                The  empty rooms of our children will have been torn down:<br />
                our  children will be lying with their own in other beds.<br />
          They  will come and go with the turning of books in far away towns</p>
              <p>I  think, if we are lucky, the photographs from inside our house<br />
                will  be carried on a coyote&rsquo;s wail into the night of western mountains.<br />
                There  will be parties by candlelight on desert slopes with desert friends.<br />
                There  will be winter streams that lay a black ice over these years<br />
                so  that we can skate over them dancing above our aging friends.<br />
          If  we are lucky, there will be no pain in letting go.</p>
