              <h1>Controlled by Ghosts</h1>
              <p>The  snows came in early over Monarch this year;<br />
                cold  right behind them, whittling away at the firewood.<br />
                I  stacked it extra high this year, seeing how thick the fur grew on the fox,<br />
                for  all the good that did because it&rsquo;s already smaller now than usual.<br />
                I  dragged dead aspens down the hill and chopped them up, piled them up<br />
                as  long as my heart could take it this year; just until one day when I said<br />
                that&rsquo;s  enough; that&rsquo;ll do it now;<br />
          and  I went blank deep down in my bones and went inside and lit a fire.</p>
              <p>The  snows came in early this year, though, even so,<br />
                and  the cold; it was so cold.&nbsp; And the snow  was so deep you couldn&rsquo;t get out,<br />
                you  couldn&rsquo;t climb the hills after awhile even when the sun was out.<br />
                You  couldn&rsquo;t climb the hills to pull down any more wood, even if you had the heart.<br />
                The  woodpile just kept getting smaller one day&rsquo;s heat at a time.<br />
                And  the wind, it just kept coming in through the chinks in the wall,<br />
                so  I&rsquo;d sit there at night burning as little wood as I could and huddled<br />
                until  my mind started wandering and I&rsquo;d think about you<br />
                I&rsquo;d  think about you and Pete going down to the store last winter,<br />
                his  arm bringing you in under the wind when you turned the corner,<br />
          not  that I could see that much up behind the aspens where I worked.</p>
              <p>My  whole life has been controlled by ghosts;<br />
                that&rsquo;s  mostly what I think about as I take the last cord of wood, piece by piece,<br />
                take  it in and pile it by the cast iron stove your Momma bought.<br />
                It  was a Christmas present the year we built this house, black and hard,<br />
                sitting  here in the middle of our home waiting for winter.<br />
                Well,  it came, of course.&nbsp; It came early that  year as well<br />
                but  of course there was a thaw come February like there usually is.<br />
                Not  this year, though, with the woodpile all but gone.<br />
                I  saw Pete, I think, yesterday way down the road,<br />
                saw  him walking almost lightly over the snow as if it wasn&rsquo;t deep at all,<br />
                standing  near the corner where the two of you used to pause,<br />
                looking  like he wasn&rsquo;t sure where he was meant to be going now. <br />
                Then  gone, of course.&nbsp; I suppose I should have  got more wood,<br />
                but  I thought I&rsquo;d got enough; always did before.<br />
                There&rsquo;s  a first time always, I guess, the cold comes down <br />
          and  stays around until it finds what it&rsquo;s looking for.</p>
