          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>Rachel  Kellum left the flatlands of central Illinois in 1993 to head for her  hummingbird-loving grandmother’s Colorado mountains. Ironically, she now lives  on Colorado’s eastern plains where clouds have curiously become her mountains,  and mountains have become her clouds. </p>
          <p>As  a college instructor of creative writing, composition, literature, humanities,  painting and art history/appreciation (usually five of these at once!), her  passion is to inspire people of all ages to live artfully.&nbsp; She is an  active member of Morgan Community College’s Center for Arts and Community  Enrichment, dedicated to bringing the visual, literary and performing arts to  Morgan County. She also leads a summer poetry-writing workshop for Wiggins’  middle school children.</p>
          <p>Kellum  holds a BFA in painting and drawing from Millikin University and an MA in  English Education from Colorado State University.&nbsp; Her thesis, <em>Composing Birth</em>, explores an emerging  genre of women’s creative non-fiction: homegrown birth narratives that  challenge the technocratic storylines of modern obstetrics. To this end, she  offers her own birth stories that are found online and in the book, <em>Journey into Motherhood: Inspirational  Stories of Natural Birth</em>.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>An  occasional actor/performer, Kellum played Stella in <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> and has performed original work in <em>The Vagina Monologues</em> and The Karen  Chamberlain Poetry Festival.</p>
          <p>Primarily  a poet, Kellum’s work is featured in various online venues—Barnwood  International Poetry Magazine, Blood Lotus, Slow Trains and others— and also on  her poetry blog, wordweeds.com.&nbsp; One of her poems was nominated for the  Pushcart Prize in 2008.  For more  information, visit www.wordweedscom.</p>
