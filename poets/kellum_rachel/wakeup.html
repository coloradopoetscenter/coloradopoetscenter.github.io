  <h1>Time to wake up</h1>  <p><em>My dream…Something good was about to  happen. I was trying to go back there.</em> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ~Samuel, age 7, in tears upon waking late for school after ignoring his  mother’s calls </p>  <p>Sometimes no matter that  we slap ourselves to stay awake,<br /> we fall asleep. We wake  within someone else’s dream,<br /> driving past their 7-11,  their grocery carts, speeding through<br />  their neighborhoods,  getting pulled over by their police.</p>  <p>We go with it. Wear  their armored brand of bra. Raise <br /> children in their schools.&nbsp; Watch their favorite movies: <br /> horror.&nbsp; They tolerate ours: foreign drama. Years pass.</p>  <p>We try to remember the  dream we were having before,<br /> the one where something  good was about to happen.</p>  <p>Then the dreamers who  pulled us in—leave,<br /> leave us in their  dream.&nbsp; We walk their streets<br /> at night. Paint their  walls. Tend their weeds.</p>  <p>We twist and kick to  wrest ourselves awake.<br /> Speak in a dream tongue  no one else speaks.<br /> The dream quakes. Its  inhabitants turn away.<br /> Maybe someone watching  us sleep sees </p>  <p>our lips move, hears the  sounds becoming heavy <br /> words:&nbsp; <em>wake me.</em> They do. We grab our children’s<br /> hands and try to pull  them through.</p>  <p>But the dream holds on  to our feet just when<br /> something good is about  to happen,</p>  <p>because something good  is about to happen,<br /> is always happening, and  to be awake means <br /> something we never  dreamed.</p>
