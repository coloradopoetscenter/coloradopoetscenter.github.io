  <h1>April Aubade</h1>  <p>When you finally <br /> sleep with the <br /> window open in <br />  a century old</p>  <p>house, the itch<br /> of April enters,<br /> a highway breathes<br /> through, trains woo</p>  <p>darkly westward. Come<br /> morning, wood pecker<br /> drills a hole<br /> into your waking</p>  <p>mind. A pin <br /> of light shines.<br /> Air sucks your<br /> closed door against</p>  <p>its frame, trying<br /> to make a<br /> path through you.<br /> Wood knocks wood.</p>  <p>Your metal mechanism<br /> clicks in its<br /> lock, hinges almost<br /> creak. Everything begs</p>  <p>a thin opening.<br />  (<em>Telluride Watch, </em>April 14, 2011) </p>
