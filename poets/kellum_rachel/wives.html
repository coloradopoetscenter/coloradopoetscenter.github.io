  <h1>Lot’s wives</h1>  <p>God has burnt <br /> us down so <br /> many times while <br /> we run screaming<br /> from the flames. <br /> But we are<br /> no phoenix rising<br /> again. We always<br /> turn to watch<br /> the walls fall, <br /> the golden licking<br /> up of sky.<br /> It is done.<br /> We freeze: columns<br /> of salt. Rain<br /> comes, melts away<br /> regret for what<br /> cannot be gotten<br /> back. Earth turns<br /> saline swallowing us.<br /> Years pass before<br /> we grow again:<br /> tall trees some<br /> man will harvest<br /> to build his <br /> city. If only <br /> we would stop<br /> turning to see<br /> turning to grieve<br /> turning to leaves,<br /> perhaps we could<br /> find out who<br /> we could be, <br /> stop following him, <br /> walk quietly away,<br /> while Lot keeps<br /> running, too weary<br /> to stop to <br />  chasten, to save. </p>
