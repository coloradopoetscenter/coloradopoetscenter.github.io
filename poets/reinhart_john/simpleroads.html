  <h1>Two Simple Roads</h1>  <p>Robert Frost was a fine<br /> mathematician. He reduced<br /> his fractions efficiently<br /> down to two roads in one<br /> wood. Modern. Scientific.<br /> Beautiful. Binary reductionism<br /> and poetic refuge denying<br /> or avoiding quantum chaos<br /> and the probability of<br /> improbability of organic<br /> human irrationality which<br /> is not a four letter word<br /> but offensive anyway<br /> because rational thinking<br /> is key to science, our<br /> modern religion, and<br />&ldquo;irrational&rdquo; sounds bad,<br /> a label for mystics and<br /> poets, when what I mean<br /> to say is simply that every<br /> one wants a forked road:<br /> left, right, even if you<br /> take the scarecrow&rsquo;s<br /> direction in Oz – both –<br /> you still only have three<br /> options for travel.<br />&nbsp;<br /> The last time I was in<br /> a wood, there was a<br /> labyrinth, Bowie and all,<br /> that appeared – hall of<br /> mirrors, trap doors, secret<br /> passages – with a hundred<br /> entrances, billion exits,<br /> chess problem with no<br /> solution, and people<br /> raced back and forth –<br /> no somber, solitary,<br /> reflective forest this,<br /> dominated by climate<br /> control, astroturf, pine<br /> scent, exposing the reality<br /> of Frost&rsquo;s apparent fifty-<br /> fifty game, clearly all<br /> or nothing in truth,<br /> this modern mathematical<br /> ruse to deny the beautiful<br /> array, meticulous matrix<br /> of maddening possibility<br /> available from one step.<br />&nbsp;<br /> I stuck out my foot<br /> to trip a passerby, then<br /> meandered aimlessly<br /> into the woods, foot<br /> following foot today.<br /><br /> (published by Dirty Chai Magazine)<br />  </p>
