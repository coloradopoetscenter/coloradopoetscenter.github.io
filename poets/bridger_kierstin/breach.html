          <h1>Boundary Breach</h1>
          <p> Pick up the button hole <br />
            or eye of needle <br />
            with hard squint <br />
            see inside <br />
            salute the high sun <br />
            see us lucid but listing <br />
          hands open&nbsp; </p>
          <p>I can conjure us <br />
            like that <br />
            dip of oar <br />
            the silvered pond <br />
            interruption of glass <br />
            the canoe- our reflection in mad <br />
            Van Gogh dashes- <br />
            un-mired by melt <br />
            we sit quietly in memory <br />
            waiting for an August noon <br />
            of yarrow perfume, <br />
            sweet sting of thistle <br />
            leading us there <br />
            Meanwhile the dirge of  March <br />
            melting ice, metal  scraping the edges <br />
            anxious grass and granitic  snow <br />
            fish writhing back to life <br />
            below the frozen surface <br />
            translucent; thin enough <br />
            to crack <br />
            with a spoon <br />
            a thimble <br />
            with a tap <br />
          without you </p>
          <p>Solace in a muddy marsh <br />
            This hard, narrow focus <br />
            as close <br />
            As I&rsquo;ll ever be <br />
            to having you back </p>
