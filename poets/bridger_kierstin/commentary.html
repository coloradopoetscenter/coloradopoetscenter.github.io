<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>&ldquo;For as smart and as talented as Kierstin is, she carries a  deep humility and desire to land a poem correctly, no matter what it takes to  get it right.&nbsp; </p>  <p>She's a leader in any group - an  outstanding human being and writer.&rdquo; <br />

 <p> &ldquo;This  poem surprised me with the way it kept creeping up in my standings as I read  and reread the entries.&nbsp;It was certainly on the short list after my first  reading, but it&rsquo;s one of those poems that reveals itself the more a reader  approaches it.&nbsp; A fine piece, the images sharp and able to penetrate  deep.&nbsp; And I love how the linear sense of time is constantly disrupted and  then re-fused (no pun intended, unless you think it&rsquo;s funny) up to such a  powerful closing stanza.&nbsp; Impressive.&rdquo; </p> <p><strong>— &ldquo;</strong>This was  the poem of yours I was most taken with …I truly love the language and energy  of these works.  &nbsp;I just loved the  way the language careened along … carrying me and everyone else and all along  with it. &nbsp;What was most striking was that, although I could <em>feel</em>&nbsp;what was going on … you  actually didn't provide much by way of concrete detail. &nbsp;This poem truly  sails along on its own wind. <br />  Poetry  editor of Memoir (and) Carl Rosenstock </p>
