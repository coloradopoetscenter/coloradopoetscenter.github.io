  <h1>You Occupy the Field</h1>  <p>You with the tiny forward slash scar<br /> marking your mustache<br /> You with your camera stare like<br /> an aspen eye<br /> <br /> You with your contrarian countenance squarely set<br /> in highgloss portrait<br /> a Bakken plain man profile<br /> captured grit in megapixel rudd<br /> <br /> unlike the old west miners, gaunt with damp <br /> and dark<br /> ungrinned for the turn of the century smoke<br /> lens<br /><br /> You the root of all western destiny, manifest in hazel glare <br /> Rough neck, stubble muzzle,<br /> chemical dust, oil soaked brim<br /><br /> Oppugn the plight of the jobless, not you sir. <br /> You follow the work, angle the consequence later, <br /> smug in the now.<br /> <br /><br /> (www.occupypoetry.org 2012)<br />  </p>
