  <h1>Number 2,764</h1>  <p> I’m running away.<br /> I’m taking all my vowels and consonants,<br /> my nouns and my transitive verbs, <br /> all my adjectives, with me.<br /> I’m taking all my words with me.<br /> They fit in one bag.<br /> They are the only words I know.<br /> I only know one story. It is the only song I sing.<br /> I’m taking my suicidal cheekbones, <br /> and the thousand tears behind my eyes.<br /> I’m taking two new dresses and a pair of high  heels.<br /> I’m running away, and I’m changing my name.<br /> I’m going to forget everything I ever was. I won’t  remember anyone.<br /> I’ll throw away the bag of words and never sing  again.</p>
