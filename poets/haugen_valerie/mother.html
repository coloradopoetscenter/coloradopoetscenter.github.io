  <h1>My Mother’s Things </h1>  <p>My mother's things...<br /> in the very last of the death boxes: <br /> umpteen beautiful crystal bottles filled <br /> with exotic perfumes from foreign lands, <br /> pounds of barbaric jewelry, ancient bones and  stones. <br /> A jug full of bells. <br /> A jug full of bells...<br /> some of them tongueless, voiceless. <br /> Poetry...even a book of poetry- the poet being an  old, dead lover <br /> of my mother Wild Honey. <br /> The belt she made at camp when she was fourteen. <br /> My second grade report card...<br /> my teacher notes my &quot;enormous  imagination&quot; and my &quot;sense of humor.&quot; <br /> (It was nice of her to write that…<br /> I can't think of anything worse than me as a funny  second-grader.) <br /> I have my mother's old love letters. <br /> She also saved every word I ever wrote to her. <br /> I have her silks - yards and yards of red silk and  purple. <br /> I'm going to make my photograph in them....the  silks. <br /> I have her passport, her library card...<br /> her statue of Obi Wan Kenobi. <br /> I have her eyes...her cheekbones....<br /> her blood....<br /> her ashes.</p>
