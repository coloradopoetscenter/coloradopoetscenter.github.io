          <h1>lady in red</h1>
          <p>I am cleaning out my closet.  <br />
            You can imagine the mess. <br />
            An infinity<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a> of black dresses. <br />
            You'd think I am, like Masha in Chekhov's The  Seagull, &quot;in mourning for my life.&quot; <br />
            I'm throwing everything out <br />
            (well actually I'm giving it all to charity). <br />
            From this day forward, I will only wear red, <br />
            from here on out. <br />
            I've saved what I have, <br />
            three red dresses, and a couple of jackets. <br />
            One is more raspberry than red, but oh what a  color. <br />
            I have saved it from the great purging. <br />
            I want to walk naked down the street, <br />
            reciting poetry. <br />
            But they put you in the loony bin for that. <br />
            Instead, I will wear my three red dresses, <br />
            in no particular order, and never all at once, <br />
            naked underneath,<br />
            and recite my poetry <br />
            anyway. </p>
