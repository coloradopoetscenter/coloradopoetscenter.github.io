  <h1>lady in red</h1>  <p>I am cleaning out my closet.Â  <br /> You can imagine the mess. <br /> An infinity<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a> of black dresses. <br /> You'd think I am, like Masha in Chekhov's The  Seagull, &quot;in mourning for my life.&quot; <br /> I'm throwing everything out <br /> (well actually I'm giving it all to charity). <br /> From this day forward, I will only wear red, <br /> from here on out. <br /> I've saved what I have, <br /> three red dresses, and a couple of jackets. <br /> One is more raspberry than red, but oh what a  color. <br /> I have saved it from the great purging. <br /> I want to walk naked down the street, <br /> reciting poetry. <br /> But they put you in the loony bin for that. <br /> Instead, I will wear my three red dresses, <br /> in no particular order, and never all at once, <br /> naked underneath,<br /> and recite my poetry <br /> anyway. </p>
