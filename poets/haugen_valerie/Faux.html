          <h1>Faux          </h1>
          <p> The fur...<br />
            isn't real. <br />
            Grandmama's fake fur coat<br />
            that she fought for hard and won<br />
            the right to wear anytime<br />
            she felt like it <br />
            in the Hard Working Bayou<br />
            where she lived.<br />
            Where the temperature is always<br />
            a hundred<br />
            but it's the humidity <br />
            that gets you. <br />
            Fake fur<br />
            that came to me<br />
            because I mentioned one day<br />
            on the phone<br />
            to my grandmother<br />
            that I was cold...<br />
            four days later a box arrived<br />
            and inside<br />
            this coat <br />
            smelling of rattlesnakes<br />
            and hurricanes.<br />
            It took three trips<br />
            to the dry cleaners<br />
            to cure it<br />
            but still<br />
            there lingers<br />
            something...<br />
            wild<br />
            the Gulf of Mexico<br />
            desire<br />
            discontent<br />
            animal and not animal<br />
            but animal</p>
