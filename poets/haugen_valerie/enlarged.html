          <h1>Enlarged to Show Detail</h1>
          <p>I always pay close attention to product messages...<br />
            the box of Mom's Best Naturals Honey Nut Toasty O's <br />
            comes with a message that the picture on the box, <br />
            the picture of the Honey Nut Toasty O's <br />
            has been &quot;ENLARGED TO SHOW DETAIL.&quot; <br />
            They don't want me to think <br />
            that an individual Honey Nut Toasty O<br />
            is really as big as my fist. <br />
            I allow myself to be reassured. </p>
          <p>The directions for my three piece espresso maker <br />
            are in Italian and English. <br />
            The English version tells me, <br />
  &quot;You must screw it well for leaking  solution.&quot; <br />
            Good warning. And it's sort of nightmarish <br />
            if you aren't careful about this one. <br />
            The leaking can be very impressive. </p>
          <p>The label on my bottle of lotion promises a Happy  Sensation. <br />
            It's almost gone now, and I realize that pinning my  hopes for happiness<br />
            on a lavender scented emolient <br />
            seems...<br />
            well... <br />
            pathetic, <br />
            but I just keep right on moisturizing. <br />
            It's been fairly happy lotion, I guess. <br />
            Not an elated lotion, but a pretty content lotion. </p>
