  <h1>Enlarged to Show Detail</h1>  <p>I always pay close attention to product messages...<br /> the box of Mom's Best Naturals Honey Nut Toasty O's <br /> comes with a message that the picture on the box, <br /> the picture of the Honey Nut Toasty O's <br /> has been &quot;ENLARGED TO SHOW DETAIL.&quot; <br /> They don't want me to think <br /> that an individual Honey Nut Toasty O<br /> is really as big as my fist. <br /> I allow myself to be reassured. </p>  <p>The directions for my three piece espresso maker <br /> are in Italian and English. <br /> The English version tells me, <br />&quot;You must screw it well for leaking  solution.&quot; <br /> Good warning. And it's sort of nightmarish <br /> if you aren't careful about this one. <br /> The leaking can be very impressive. </p>  <p>The label on my bottle of lotion promises a Happy  Sensation. <br /> It's almost gone now, and I realize that pinning my  hopes for happiness<br /> on a lavender scented emolient <br /> seems...<br /> well... <br /> pathetic, <br /> but I just keep right on moisturizing. <br /> It's been fairly happy lotion, I guess. <br /> Not an elated lotion, but a pretty content lotion. </p>
