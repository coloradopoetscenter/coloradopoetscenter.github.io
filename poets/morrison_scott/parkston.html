<h1>Parkston: POP. 1432 +2</h1>
<p>Every time John's Maroon '82 Chevy <br />backfired past the sign, <br />he thought of her.<br />Passing it nightly <br />on his way to Sud's Bar.<br />The &quot;+ 2&quot; was their symbol. <br />The sign preserved forbidden love.<br />&nbsp;<br />You and me together. <br />Forget about everyone else.<br />Jade's Lakota accent<br />rings clearly in his memory.<br />&nbsp;<br />An outcast white world.<br />Pressure boiled and mixed <br />with Vicodin and Jack Daniel's. <br />He cried as they carried her<br />away in the ambulance.<br />&nbsp;<br />At Sud's, alone with memory,<br />his sorrows drown<br />  in pitchers of stale beer.</p>
(<em>Pasque Petals</em>)
