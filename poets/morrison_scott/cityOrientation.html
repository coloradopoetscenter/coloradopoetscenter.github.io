<h1>City's Orientation</h1>
<p>It's four o' clock,<br />we scramble to the mud room.<br />Carhartt coveralls, stocking caps,<br />and Tingley over-boots.<br />&nbsp;<br />Winter's first snow blankets <br />northeast Nebraska. <br />The Gator carves powder to dairy barn.<br />  Work begins.</p>
<p>A new-born bucket-calf learns to  drink-<br />tuber extending mouth to stomach.<br />His legs too limp to stand-<br />cleanings hang from mother's backside.<br />&nbsp;<br />Everything's a process here.<br />You can tell her age by the size of  her udder.<br />My girlfriend says pointing to  &quot;Grandma,&quot; <br />the oldest Holstein. <br />&nbsp;<br />We move month-old calves<br />from huts to the corral.<br />They go in stomping hooves in protest.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Show'em whose boss.<br />Grab'em by the tail and pull!<br />Ten-year-old Maria explains. <br />&nbsp;<br />I am out of place, I'm sure of it. <br />But I'll stick around-<br />  learn a thing or two. </p>
