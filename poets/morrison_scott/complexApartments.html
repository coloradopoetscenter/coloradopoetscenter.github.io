<h1>Complex Apartments</h1>
<p>After the nine hour drive,<br />he arrives in the congested parking  lot, <br />his father's dusty Denver apartment  building. <br />&nbsp;<br />Grasping for bags,<br />he ascends cobblestone staircase.<br />The door opens and he is met<br />by gray-speckled-mustache smile.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bags fly down, hands embrace.<br />Greetings volley and <br />memories rush back.<br />&nbsp;<br />Turning to TV,<br />the son spots Peyton Manning <br />and stares as the football spirals <br />downfield on a mid winter's day.<br />&nbsp;<br />With stealthy surprise<br />his father springs to action. <br />He throws arms violently <br />until his bicep presses against<br />his son's innocent neck.<br />&nbsp;<br />Trapped in the infamous headlock,<br />forced to breathe in <br />his father's Old Spice deodorant, <br />  he is home.</p>
<p> (<em>Paddlefish</em>)</p>
