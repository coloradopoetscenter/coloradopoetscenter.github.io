<h1>White River Electric: The Break Room</h1>
<p>At the old electric Co-op life is  simple.<br />At 4:30, they trickle in a few at a  time.<br />The linemen trod pearly tile <br />with mud-caked, steel-toed boots.<br />The janitor stumbles in, <br />Hodgkin's biting at once sturdy legs.<br />&nbsp;<br />The oil-stained mechanic rests in the  corner, <br />a smile framed on his humble face. <br />The summer help arrives in<br />cutoffs and baggy jeans. <br />&nbsp;<br />Around a large break table, <br />done for the day- <br />The scene comes to life.<br />&nbsp;<br />Toby Keith's &quot;I Love This  Bar&quot;<br />blares throughout the room.<br />Lets get this game started <br />an ambitious lineman yells, <br />Busch Light in hand.<br />&nbsp;<br />The janitor trembles shuffling the  greasy deck <br />adorned by a sexy blonde Centerfold.<br />He deals one by one, <br />nickels and dimes roll to table  center.<br />&nbsp;<br />The cool head lineman peeks over his  hand.<br />Slowly he outbids his cocky, young  opponent.<br />O...I guess ill raise ya fifty cents. <br />&nbsp;<br />I'll put you all in! <br />Immersed in confidence, <br />the summer helper sits strong with <br />three ladies winking at him.<br />&nbsp;<br />What's this kid trying to pull over  here?<br />  My Lord, I guess I'll call you. </p>
<p>Reluctance pads the boy's confidence.<br />Flashing his yellow-stained teeth,<br />He turns the Queens.<br />  Beat that old man!</p>
<p>The lineman chuckles revealing his  cards.<br />Aces over Deuces, Full House. <br />  Better luck next time, young buck.</p>
