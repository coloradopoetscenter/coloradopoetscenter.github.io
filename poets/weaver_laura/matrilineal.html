              <p>How stories would sew us  one to the other&mdash;<br />
                the shape of my body  against time,<br />
                the shadow of yours, and  yet we speaking <br />
                across generations,  having genetic conversations&mdash;<br />
                how a cell comes to know  when to divide, <br />
                or a chromosome how to  color the eyes, or curl the hair.<br />
                How it is to see your own  face reappear in another,<br />
          nested there like  history&rsquo;s strange bird.</p>
              <p>I would not know your  hospital room,<br />
                or the twin engines of  your beauty and disease, <br />
                but something in the  breast recognizes, something calls<br />
                names across the lines of  the living and dead.&nbsp; You<br />
                are the womb of the womb  that carried my own,<br />
                and already, when my  daughter was born, she carried<br />
                the eggs of my  grandchildren. As if that is all that we are, <br />
          mere vessels&mdash;but  no&mdash;something more, bodies </p>
              <p>that unfold history, our  blood on every doorstep. <br />
                The way you birthed my  mother while sleeping, body sipping <br />
                on the heavy drip of  anaesthesia.&nbsp; The rough tongue <br />
                of the world licking you  back, pushing your baby <br />
                into your arms, saying  she is yours, and you saying, <br />
                This?&nbsp; Me? And I, who twisted and turned like a  blind mole, <br />
                cord around the neck  three times, the noose of my life&mdash;<br />
          the forceps tugging my  tiny blue body out.&nbsp; Then I passed into </p>
              <p>the birthing fire with my  own, wide-awake&mdash;bald with pain, <br />
                the head breaking through  the way the bulb pushes up soil, <br />
                that crushing before  opening out into air. How tangled <br />
                these births, these  rivers that run through the body over <br />
                and over until furrows  form, inherited, tendencies appearing <br />
                over time like bright,  errant threads. These are our stories, <br />
                clutched in the hand like  wildflowers.&nbsp; Pick one&mdash;find <br />
          the longest stem, the  deepest throat&mdash;the very ovary housing</p>
              <p>the queen bee who will  sting you again and again, her venom <br />
                paining you so deeply  that it saves your life.</p>
