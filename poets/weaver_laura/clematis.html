<h1>Clematis</h1>
<p>When I reach into the earth <br />I reach for stars&mdash;the rough bump</p>
<p>of seed swelling itself into flesh. When <br />I search for you in the middle of the night </p>
<p>I move towards the beyond&mdash;the  curve <br />of your hip a valley I have walked over </p>
<p>and over like a nomad. The cottonwoods <br />shed their fluffy seed, the tender grass bolts, </p>
<p>the press of summer is upon us.&nbsp; I shift plants <br />in moonlight to act out this restless </p>
<p>stirring to spread beyond first planting.&nbsp; <br />We build only to tear down, to relocate.&nbsp; Tonight </p>
<p>your fingers rub tomato vines, trace the tendrils <br />of clematis dancing up the lattice on the axis </p>
<p>of the sky.&nbsp;  Already we have forgotten the barren <br />nights.&nbsp; We stand  on teetering apple ladders, reaching </p>
<p>for the fruit just beyond the green fur<br />of leaf&mdash;our want a kite tugging to get off</p>
<p>its leash.&nbsp; Then  where would we go?&nbsp; Would we find <br />sky in that floating?&nbsp;  Or would we long only </p>
<p>for our feet on the ground, hands in the earth, <br />mouth upon mouth in a wild, unweeded garden?</p>
