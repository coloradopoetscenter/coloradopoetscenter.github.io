<h1>Critical Commentary:</h1>
<p> &quot;Laura Weaver&rsquo;s work is nothing less than an &ldquo;Axis Mundi&rdquo;&#157; for the spirit. Her negative  capability is passionate and leads us from bear, elk, beggar child, lightning,  and an Alzheimer&rsquo;s Unit&#157; to an entropic world salvaged in grace.&nbsp; Her poems are brilliant, compassionate, regenerative,  expansive, and memorable.&quot;<br />-Mark Irwin<em>, White City  and Bright Hunger</em></p>
