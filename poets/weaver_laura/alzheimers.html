              <h1>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Unit</h1>
              <p><em>for Norma</em></p>
              <p>Moments strung  together because <br />
              we have linked  them that way. One year<br />
              follows  another. The quivering quail egg<br />
          releases a  quail.&nbsp; Each memory a bead </p>
              <p>on a necklace,  a story we have told<br />
              ourselves over  and over until it stays.&nbsp;<br />
              Then the beads  scatter<br />
              across the  floor, the mind unraveling<br />
          like  a spool. See its tangled pattern&mdash;</p>
              <p>a  hand raised to say something it has <br />
                already  forgotten.&nbsp; All the images bleeding <br />
                through  so that time runs together, becomes a vast <br />
                blue  lake, the barren blue of her gaze<br />
          as  eyes shift and shift and hold onto nothing.</p>
              <p>There  are holes between thoughts, <br />
                a  synapse like a vast chasm she jumps<br />
                into,  never reaching the other side.<br />
                Spaces  widen, swallow far and distant<br />
                stars,  the brain thinning, diffusing<br />
                like  an ever expanding universe,<br />
          more  and more dark matter.</p>
              <p>In  a hospital room, I watch her snip <br />
                scissors  through air at lengths <br />
                of  hair that once dropped to the small <br />
                of  her back.&nbsp; She plays notes on the broken <br />
                hammers  of a piano, presses ghost songs <br />
                into  the keys, burns up and down <br />
                these  bonewhite hallways<br />
          searching  for her own name.</p>
