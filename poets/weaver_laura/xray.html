              <h1><strong>X-Ray</strong></h1>
              <p>Because a woman asks for change<br />
                and I look through her  like an x-ray,<br />
          her thin brittle bones my  own.</p>
              <p>Because the boy&rsquo;s boat in  the fountain<br />
                drifts back and forth  without wind,<br />
                and the smell of bread in  the air<br />
          is like the sexing of  bodies.</p>
              <p>Because I wear a pebble  in my shoe<br />
                to remind myself to  live&nbsp; live&nbsp; live<br />
                like a lizard unfreezing  itself<br />
          from the net of a great  shadow.</p>
              <p>Because I hold a dying  rabbit&mdash;<br />
                neck just snapped by  jaws,<br />
                heat pouring into my  hands<br />
          until I, too, have lost  my boundaries.</p>
              <p>Because when the  starlings lift <br />
                from the elm, I hear my  own words <br />
          shake down over the  greening earth like salt.</p>
