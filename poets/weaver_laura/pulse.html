<h1>Pulse</h1>
<p>One day inside a magnet <br />a machine spoke to me in  pulses, shifted neutrons <br />  to make images&mdash;then I saw  it&mdash;</p>
<p>a growth in my brain&mdash; the  cross-sections<br />of lobes like butterfly  wings, or the shapes <br />of storm clouds over  curves of land.&nbsp; <br />I wanted to touch the  thin cushion <br />of the dura between skull  and cerebrum, that moat.&nbsp; <br />And that dark mass  nested&nbsp; <br />  inside the pituitary, </p>
<p>where chemicals flash to  jump-sweep <br />through bloodstream, tell  the body how to grow, <br />when to go fertile, how  to stop the bleeding,<br />  when to soften the stalks  of our bones.</p>
<p>That night, I dreamt the  lamp <br />of the surgical table,  the scalpel that cuts <br />the tissue away, as if to  unhook a miscaught fish&mdash;<br />the doctor leaning over,  saying&nbsp; <br /><em>you do not have to die for this</em>.&nbsp; And I  waking <br />to this same flesh of  wind and wire, this skeleton <br />of holes and starlight&mdash;to  watch my own unpiecing,<br />  to feel the dredge of  adrenaline in my blood.</p>
<p>That morning the earth  was violet with crocus,<br />snowmelt painting the  valley with first green.<br />I watched the world pour  through<br />to shift sand, cleave  bedrock, dissolve the calcified&mdash;<br />felt it drive into my  body, break the husk <br />  so I could remember how  to bloom.</p>
