              <h1>Bond</h1>
              <p>i.<br />
                What binds us is heat,<br />
                the taste of fire on the  tongue.<br />
                What binds us is breath,<br />
                the push pull, one lung<br />
                into the other. Inhale. <br />
                Exhale.&nbsp; The push pull of a child <br />
                breaking through the  bower <br />
                of the mother to drink  first light, <br />
                to hear the sound  paintings&mdash;<br />
                brush strokes of words  moving <br />
          like tiny hands through  grass.</p>
              <p>ii.&nbsp; <br />
                My child toddles towards  me<br />
                calling my name over and  over.&nbsp; It could be<br />
                any word, his name for  the world now.<br />
                Sometimes a voice like  his breaks into a dream<br />
                where flowers grow  beneath ice and his face<br />
                never changes.&nbsp; Then he shifts,<br />
                turns from babe to boy to  man.<br />
                A seam presses us apart,<br />
          quivers, almost breaking.</p>
              <p>iii.&nbsp; <br />
                Look.&nbsp; The story awakens in the body.<br />
                These hunks of hands fall  on each other.&nbsp; The young <br />
                eat apples, sift sand,  and in time punch flesh,<br />
                twist wool into yarn,  turn their palms <br />
          to the night and ask why.</p>
              <p>The leeks in the garden  grow globes of flowers.<br />
                Everything reaches now,  turning to dizzy seed.<br />
                I want you to listen to  the cadence of wandering light,<br />
                to the way our bodies  angle towards it.&nbsp; Can you see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          how our faces are burned  from looking back?</p>
              <p>iv.<br />
                And then my boy says  ball, ball, ball, <br />
                with this first word,  undifferentiated, the round shadow<br />
          flying away from the  earth, disappears into the sun.</p>
