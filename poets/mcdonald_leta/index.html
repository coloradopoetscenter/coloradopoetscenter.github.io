<p>Leta G.  McDonald is a semi-retired Jungian Therapist.&nbsp;  In 2000 she completed a book of her poetry and water color paintings as  part of the requirements for a doctorate from the Union Institute.&nbsp; In this book, MANDALA MOON, she strove to honor  and exemplify the feminine archetype, the focus of her doctoral work.&nbsp; Since then, her poetry has continued to  stress subjective themes. </p>
<p>Her work as  one of five editors for the poetry journal<em> HeartLodge </em>requires much of her time, especially in the spring when she  designs and formats the journal.&nbsp; Then  she is able to again combine her artistic and poetic skills.</p>
<p>She has also  taken part in several shows of <em>Braided  Lives: A Collaboration Between Artists and Poets</em>, held in Taos,  Denver, San Francisco  and Taos.&nbsp; The fun of reading one&rsquo;s poetry to a  receptive audience is addicting.&nbsp; .&nbsp; </p>
<p>Presently she  lives with her husband Phil and cat Sophie in a condo by Denver&rsquo;s  Cheesman Park, and hopes the quiet view attracts  her muse.&nbsp; </p>
