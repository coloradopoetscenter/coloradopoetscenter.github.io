              <h1>Your final few</h1>
              <p>days when hospice <br />
                coffee serves me structure,<br />
          respite from the urgent ebbing of time:</p>
              <p>One </p>
              <p>Like a fire ant&mdash;<br />
                across the hallways, past<br />
                slippered women knitting<br />
                baby caps and afghans, past<br />
                the porch where an unbowed<br />
                man lights up his last pack&mdash;<br />
                I carry the nineteen inch<br />
          television you will never turn on.</p>
              <p>Two </p>
              <p>Four o&rsquo;clock is happy hour<br />
                unhesitating you order<br />
                Harvey Wallbanger, sending<br />
          volunteers off for ingredients.</p>
              <p>Nights are bad&mdash;weeping<br />
                for losses and loves, counting <br />
                them, holding each one <br />
          in memory&rsquo;s vigil.</p>
              <p>Three </p>
              <p>Our world narrows to bathroom and bed. <br />
                I Oil of Olay your arms<br />
                legs and vanishing body, knee<br />
                scarred from a lost sack race at Rod<br />
                &amp; Gun club, when together we endured<br />
                picking pebbles from your wound.<br />
                Earlier we poached California<br />
                poppies that would struggle to live<br />
          in backyard loam.</p>
              <p>Four </p>
              <p> Nurse says It will be soon.  Your feet<br />
                feel cold to my touch.  Swing Low<br />
                Sweet Chariot I sing.  Mother<br />
                you are going home<br />
                can you hear me?  No answer<br />
                just a hand moving up down<br />
                then still<br />
          I close my eyes and you are gone.</p>
