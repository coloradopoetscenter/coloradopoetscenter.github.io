  <h1>Life Lines</h1>  <p>today  the priest said<br /> that  what he loves most<br /> about  Mass<br /> is  looking at the people&rsquo;s hands<br /> as  they reach out to him;<br /> holding  their palms up to God </p>  <p>the  gnarled, wrinkled hands<br /> toasted  brown by sun and calloused<br /> by  shovel handles, wheelbarrows<br /> and  heavy loads<br /> the  small, freshly pink<br /> hands  of children, wearing white<br /> to  ones with nails manicured<br /> so  perfect and fragile<br /> they  reject anything on them<br /> for  fear they&rsquo;ll break<br /> the  hands that are missing fingers<br /> and  thumbs<br /> the  ones scarred<br /> or  so loaded with rings you wonder<br /> how  they&rsquo;re being held up<br /> and  the ones not strong enough<br /> to  be held out<br /> and  so you can only guess<br /> at  them, if you&rsquo;ve got the<br /> time </p>  <p>it  makes me wonder what<br /> my  hands look like<br /> as  the body of Christ<br /> descends  into my possession<br /> in  ingestion </p>  <p>because  I&rsquo;m trying to look at them<br /> on  my own<br /> but  I come up blank </p>  <p>I  guess I&rsquo;m too close<br /> to  my own skin<br /> to  read<br /> my  own lifelines </p>  <p>[Published  in <em>Time of Singing</em> (print,  Pennsylvania)]</p>
