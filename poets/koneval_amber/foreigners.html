  <h1>Foreigners,  You Are Welcome</h1>  <p><em>Wageni  mwakaribishwa</em> <br /> <em>&nbsp;</em>in the  name of the sugar cane<br /> the  thick banana trees pregnant with hard work,<br /> watered  with<br /> sweat<br /> and  tears that fall from honey eyes<br /> the  whites stung with yellow by the<br /> wasps  of disease-<br /> eyes  that smile, nonetheless<br /> as  the stroke of the machete fells<br /> years  of sacrifice<br /> just  to give us a taste<br /> of  what they have<br /> that  is worth fighting for </p>  <p><em>Wageni  mwakaribishwa</em> <br /> <em>&nbsp;</em>in the  name of the drying mud<br /> pounded  by the feet of children<br /> who  delight in the sight<br /> of  our pale moon skin<br /> feet  calloused to the rocks of the<br /> unpaved  roads they run<br /> fleet  as the gods of wind<br /> just  to give us a taste<br /> of  what they have<br /> that  is worth running for </p>  <p><em>Wageni  mwakaribishwa</em> <br /> <em>&nbsp;</em>in the  name of the tasteless&nbsp;<em>ugali</em><br /> dipped  and rolled in the juices of<br /> a  freshly slaughtered chicken<br /> the  blood of a dignity<br /> that  could rival ten thousand princes<br /> held  in the thin necks<br /> and  gnarled backs, warped with time<br /> and  the indifference of spineless nations-<br /> at  least they have the bones to<br /> hold  them up,<br /> these  simple village people with their<br /> simple  village joys;<br /> and  their bottomless hearts<br /> and  their borderless dreams:<br /> these  they show us<br /> just  to give us a taste<br /> of  what it&rsquo;s like<br />  to  be worth dying for.</p>  <p>[Published  in <em>The Wayfarer</em> (online &amp; in  print, Homebound Publications)]</p>
