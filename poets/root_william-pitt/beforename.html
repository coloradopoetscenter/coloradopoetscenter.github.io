<h1>Before I had a Name </h1>
<p>The first voices to reach my  ears-- still bloodwet, crumpled, <br />
half-clogged in birth-grease  as my head rocked in the harbor of thighs, <br />
eyes slits in the shock of  first light, arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pinned flipper-like  writhing <br />
among slick walls too  constricted for even the first scald of air--,<br />
the first voices I heard  after knowing <br />
only the weather of  blood-thrum, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the seasons of breathing,<br />
the rush of core fluids  gurgling like cavewater over stones, <br />
were the voices debating my  decapitation and dismemberment. </p>
<p>For I, though I was a  10-month baby, I was slow in coming, <br />huge blue galleon stalled  between the shifting stones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pelvic bones of my  mother.<br />I was in trouble before I had  a name, receiving instruction in how <br />no trouble is ever one's own,  always is shared by another. <br />My mother lay helplessly  glowing with sweat and exhaustion,<br />the great moonbelly  contracting and squeezing for life, hers, mine, <br />  as wise men conversed by a  table set with the tools of our undoing.</p>
<p>So these were the voices,  desperately hushed, deliberate, <br />and this my first brush with  air, breath-taking, benumbing,<br />glove-pale hands  outstretched, gaudy with the blood of my birth.<br />Masked faces glared, remote  eyes hardening against me<br />among the low moans and sharp  yips of my mother<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I, strangling, I, burning blue, <br />was trying to suck the great  emptiness-- <br />birth-whale beached in the  heavy coat of being <br />caving in these lungs that  wanted to&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open  expansive in the light <br />of this other world, this  sphere before knowing, <br />where everything was luminous  in robes of loose mist, <br />even the scalpels decisively  angled in hands so close--,<br />when the great thrust came  that shoved me clear<br />  and I fell, delivered into  their hands, at last.&nbsp; </p>
