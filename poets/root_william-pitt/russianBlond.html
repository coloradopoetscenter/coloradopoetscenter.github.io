              <h1>For a Russian Blond who wished before sleeping that someone might write her a poem to read when she awoke</h1>
              <p>I would pity the  blind<br />
who&rsquo;ll never<br />
dazzle in the fair  fire<br />
of your Russian  hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except<br />
that they may know  you<br />
by the fountain<br />
of your leaping  voice,<br />
the graceful flight<br />
of your excitement.</p>
              <p>I would pity the  deaf<br />
                blind to your voice,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except <br />
                that with their eyes<br />
                they have such  access<br />
                to those delicately<br />
                soaring hands<br />
                you speak with<br />
                and to the tender<br />
                brilliance of<br />
                hair you sweep<br />
                from eyes<br />
                blue as the sun<br />
                to those<br />
          you look upon.</p>
              <p>Then I would apply<br />
                my pity<br />
                to companions too  distant<br />
                to see you<br />
                go about the  dailiness<br />
                of living like<br />
                a flame innocent<br />
                of the light and  warmth<br />
                it shares merely by  being<br />
                what it is,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except<br />
          that even they</p>
              <p>have memory <br />
                to know you by.</p>
              <p>Finally then,<br />
                I will pity<br />
                those who know you  now<br />
                only by this poem,<br />
                hopelessly aware<br />
                they must live out<br />
                their remaining  lives<br />
                tantalized by the  bare<br />
                possibility<br />
                of a chance  encounter<br />
                with such a one,<br />
                whose very name<br />
                means<br />
                whence the honey flows,<br />
                that cataract <br />
                of sweetest light<br />
                by which,<br />
                as you sleep,<br />
          I write.</p>
