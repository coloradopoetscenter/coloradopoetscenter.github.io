              <h1>Crossing the Rez</h1>
              
              <p>I was hitching a ride  toward twilight<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; southeast of Billings,  middle of November, <br />
                when a pickup let me toss  my gear in back.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I climbed up into the cab boozy with two old boys,<br />
                Country Western AM blaring  sad songs of love. <br />
                The driver's sidekick  cackled &quot;Cold enough out there<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to  chrome a bobcat's balls.&quot; He hoisted a pint <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Jack, black, shoved it into my chapped hands.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It nearly thawed my tongue as they both jawboned <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down  the road, pointing out into the blue dark<br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;toward Custer's Last Stand. &quot;Never trust no  Injun, <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;bud, no matter <em>how</em> cold it gits,&quot;  they soberly <br />
                advised, shaking their  heads and slowing down, <br />
          dropping me off there smack  on the Rez at sunset. </p>
              <p>And there I stood the best  part of a bad hour<br />
                until along came the first  car that stopped, <br />
                a rumpled one-eyed station  wagon, front bumper <br />
                dangling, muffler skidding  ice-glazed blacktop <br />
                just like a kid's sparkler  in the dark. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hop in, par'ner,&quot;<br />
                and in I hopped, stiff with  cold, duffle on my lap,<br />
                all the wide dark faces, in  front and back,<br />
                flat and friendly as old  Hank Williams<br />
                carried on about good love  gone bad again<br />
                from a scratchy speaker  loose on the dash.<br />
                One popped the top on a Bud  for me as gradually<br />
                we picked up speed, tranny  wailing like a wolf,<br />
                everybody howling  themselves into Hank's fix,<br />
                off-key and flat, while we  hurtled through <br />
                the dark in a one-eyed  comet. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where you headed?&quot; <br />
                I answered &quot;Sheridan.&quot; He  nodded, smiled. <br />
  &quot;Thing is, par'ner, we  can't take you there. <br />
                Off-rez cops, they catch us  in this heap, <br />
                hey, it's bail-time in the Rockies. When <br />
                we drop you at Wyola, just <br />
                remember this: Cold as your  ass gets<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;don't park it in no cowboy pickup,<br />
                you'll do just fine. And do  say howdy<br />
                for us In'dins to all the  pretty girls<br />
          you meet on down the  line.&quot;</p>
