<h1>Biography</h1>

<p>For over ten years I commuted twice a week between Tucson (where I was that city&rsquo;s first Poet Laureate  1997-2002) and upper East side Manhattan to  teach in the writing program at HunterCollege. I&rsquo;ve also been  Visiting Writer at New York University, Amherst  College, Interlochen  Arts Academy,  University of Montana etc. and as Distinguished Visiting Writer at Wichita State  University and Pacific LutheranUniversity.&nbsp; In the 70&rsquo;s-80&rsquo;s, as a Poet-in-the-Schools, I  taught in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Vermont,  Mississippi, including work with the Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Tohono O&rsquo;odham,  Navajo, Hopi, and Wind River Nations. After years, first as a student then as a teacher  in colleges and universities, the experience of encouraging children to write  imaginatively restored my sense of the wonder at the root of poetry; working  with native children gave me the chance to see into a world where the everyday  sacred nature of the world was still intact and vital to so many hearts and  minds.&rdquo; </p>

<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also taken jobs as a laborer throughout the west: in  Washington, I&nbsp; worked as a bouncer in  pre-World&rsquo;s Fair Pioneer Square, as night manager for a fuel oil company, in  stockrooms, in a shipyard, and as an experimental subject for the U.S.A.&rsquo;s  first manned space flight (all in Seattle); in California I worked in a factory  (Stockton), at a department store, in a bank, and as a Teamster unloading  railroad cars (San Francisco), moving furniture (Manhattan Beach), washing  dishes (Fort Bragg); in Arizona he worked first as a chute-tapper at a copper  mine half a mile underground (San Manuel) then as Poet Laureate (Tucson). I&rsquo;ve worked since  I was 1l, when my father was killed and we lost everything. There was little  choice about it, but necessity threw me into many situations that challenged my  preconceptions about both the world and myself. Writing was an early life-line;  ultimately it was a link to the great mothership of literature and the arts,  their implied communities inexhaustibly various and rich in the companionship  and adventure that so rarely materializes in daily life.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Now he and his wife, poet Pamela Uschuk, live in Southwestern Colorado near the Weminuche Wilderness with a cadre of animal companions  including the wolf-dogs Happy and Lulu, plus Sadie (born a kitty she soon opted  to be a wolf too). Summer 2006, they  will team-teach a workshop for Prague Summer Programs. When not off giving readings or acting as poetry editor for CutThroat, A Journal of the Arts, Root enjoys hiking, kayaking, canoeing, or  just heading off for the backcountry with an old SLR Nikon in his even older  Land Cruiser.&nbsp; Poetry, he suggests, is a news and  weather report from the soul.</p>
