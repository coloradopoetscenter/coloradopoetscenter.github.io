<h1>Orpheus Reconsidered</h1>
<p>It  had been some time, as you'll remember,<br />
since  he'd seen her.</p>
<p>And  time which, for the living, flashes <br />for  the dead drags.</p>
<p>Down  there among the joyless shades <br /> he took no food, but she</p>
<p>being  educated in an epic hunger<br />and  knowledge of the bone</p>
<p>had  long since grown quite ravenous,<br />her  sweet eyes savage flames</p>
<p>and  her heart a cauldron<br />of  scoured emptiness</p>
<p>in  which his richest wildest lyrics <br />rang too thin, too tame</p>
<p>so  when he'd struck the bargain<br />we  all know, and turned </p>
<p> to start the long climb back<br />still  piping his tune,</p>
<p> before they'd gone halfway<br />she  filled with scorn</p>
<p>since  he would not regard her<br /> there behind him </p>
<p>seething  with resentments<br />no  simple lyric could appease:</p>
<p>If  he could not love</p>
<p>her  cheeks of ash,<br /> her lips of carrion,</p>
<p>her  heart half-wed now<br />to  an elder darkness,</p>
<p>she  would not belong to a boy<br />who  kept his word to demons</p>
<p>rather  than to his own heart.<br />She  turned before he turned</p>
<p>to  find her gone. And she fed<br />
on  the promises Death kept.  </p>
