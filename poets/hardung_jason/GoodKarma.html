  <h1>Good Karma</h1>  <p>Reading Simic in low light<br /> in a back  booth of a truck stop bar. Outside<br /> trees like preachers<br /> raise their palms, icy and wooden<br /> above the street--<br /> sorry for our sins<br /> sorry for our happiness.<br /> This place is beautiful and worn out.<br /> Yesterday believed in sun, today<br /> my lungs are frozen.<br /> A man with a guitar and a dog--<br /> eyes like war photographers seek<br /> comes in off the highway<br /> asks for a cigarette<br /> trying to get to Denver, he says.<br /> I'll give him one<br /> only if he'll play me a song.<br /> He strums Walk The Line.<br /> I believe every word<br /> hand him three cigarettes<br /> and buy him a pint of Ten High.<br /> He hugs me<br /> God bless God bless and fades<br /> back into the cold.<br /> I see him on the exit ramp<br /> flying a sign<br /> the bottle to his lips<br /> the dog sitting at his feet<br />  I drive home.</p>
