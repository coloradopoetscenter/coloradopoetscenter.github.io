          <h1>Good Karma</h1>
          <p>Reading Simic in low light<br />
            in a back  booth of a truck stop bar. Outside<br />
            trees like preachers<br />
            raise their palms, icy and wooden<br />
            above the street--<br />
            sorry for our sins<br />
            sorry for our happiness.<br />
            This place is beautiful and worn out.<br />
            Yesterday believed in sun, today<br />
            my lungs are frozen.<br />
            A man with a guitar and a dog--<br />
            eyes like war photographers seek<br />
            comes in off the highway<br />
            asks for a cigarette<br />
            trying to get to Denver, he says.<br />
            I'll give him one<br />
            only if he'll play me a song.<br />
            He strums Walk The Line.<br />
            I believe every word<br />
            hand him three cigarettes<br />
            and buy him a pint of Ten High.<br />
            He hugs me<br />
            God bless God bless and fades<br />
            back into the cold.<br />
            I see him on the exit ramp<br />
            flying a sign<br />
            the bottle to his lips<br />
            the dog sitting at his feet<br />
          I drive home.</p>
