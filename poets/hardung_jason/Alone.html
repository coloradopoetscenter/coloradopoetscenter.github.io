  <h1>Alone In a Vietnamese Restaruant</h1>  <p> Most men are content with being mediocre<br />  they attract mediocre women<br />  and have mediocre children<br />  that score mediocre in school.<br />  They dance at weddings<br />  have a favorite football team<br />  whose jersey they wear around the house on Sunday<br />  they go shopping on Saturday.<br />  Their cars are above mediocre though.<br />  They are proud of their car-<br />  it scored above average in three of five categories<br />  in Car and Driver magazine.<br />  They wax it before they go shopping on Saturday.<br />  I'm not saying I'm any better<br />  because baby I'm not,<br />  I just realize it.<br />  I dress like a blind man <br />  fall asleep at three in the afternoon<br />  I fall in love with women<br />  I've never met,<br />  and miss every woman I've slept with more than once.<br />  When I was 21 I convinced myself I was Jesus<br />  except with the sad blue eyes and song writing skills of Kurt Cobain.<br />  Today, I ate alone in a Vietnamese restaurant<br />  where a baby cried and I watched<br />  the wind blow trash down the sidewalk.<br />  Another time<br />  I fancied myself a genius--<br />  Everything is moved by pistons and rods<br />  aÂ robot bleeds in the parking lot<br />  as the car leaks oils<br />  a river runs through the uterus of a lion<br />  the sun doesn't have a soul mate <br />  the sky really isn't blue it's the color of blood<br />  and the moon is just a pitiful excuse for light.<br />  Some men build bridges<br />  others live under them<br />  and some jump off.<br />  Jesus was good looking because<br />  people wouldn't worship an ugly person.<br />  But now I realize I am nothing more<br />  than a hunted fox,<br />  terrified and cunning<br />  running away<br />  while you believe<br />  every word<br />  I just said.</p>
