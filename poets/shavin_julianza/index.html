          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>Julianza (Julie) K. Shavin hails from the southeastern Bible Belt, a constriction she never really suffered, because her writer/father and artist/mother were, happily, if distressingly, non-conformingly, beltless (explaining, perhaps, her conception). She began journaling at age 11, composing her first “real” poem in fifth grade, stunning both teacher and class with its vivid imagery and inane, unbridled absurdity. &quot;Star of the Mangled Pain&quot; has not become a classic in the annals of literature.</p>
          <p>Julianza edited her high school newspaper and literary magazine, was one of two graduation speakers, and was chosen for Emory University's promotion al brochure, receiving a scholarship for excellence in writing and music composition. She holds degrees in English and Philosophy, with graduate studies in English and Counseling. She was poetry editor of her college literary magazine, is a licensed professional proofreader, and former journalist holding several editorial positions. She is past Salon Coordinator, Newsletter Editor, Vice-President, and President of Poetry West, a thriving <a href="http://www.poetrywest.org/">Colorado Springs-based collective </a> currently she is VP in charge of  Programmming. She has performed both original poetry and music for the &quot;Classically Alive&quot; music salon series and serves on the Board of Directors of The Pikes Peak Arts Council.</p>
          <p>Shavin's greatest literary loves include Lawrence Durrell, Dylan Thomas, John Keats, Anne Sexton, Mark Strand, John Donne, Maxine Kumin, Dylan Thomas, Mark Jarman, Leonore Wilson, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Robinson Jeffers, Conrad Aiken, Sylvia Plath, John Milton, Delmore Schwartz, Richard Wilbur, Sidney Lanier, Diane Ackerman, and Leonard Cohen, to name a few. </p><p>
            She claims to be a “relentless reviser to the point of insanity,” in terms of poetry, her greatest passion besides music composition. She has had several of her artworks selected as covers for or as inclusion within literary magazines both in-state and out. In September, 2011, before serving on the Arts Council Board, she was named Pikes Peak Performance Poet of the Year, followed by Page Poet in 2012.

            Julie has authored three poetry books,  The Snake Will be There Soon, In the Air, Against the Air, and Of Mortality a Music.  She is at work on a fourth book tentatively titled An Octave Above the Sea, to be published by Ripple Effect Press, LLC. She has been published in twenty-five or so journals and anthologies, has won several awards –most recently, three—  through the National Federation of State Poetry Societies, and was a Tupelo Press 30/30 poet December 2013.</p>
