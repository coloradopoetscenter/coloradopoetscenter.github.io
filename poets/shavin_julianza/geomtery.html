<h1>Geometery</h1>
<p>I watched your back as you strode<br />
the horizon's infinite triangle<br />
sturdy limbs retreating you,<br />
whose palms, knees had never<br />
rectangled my torso, thinking<br />
of the gaze never concentric,<br />
heart-kisses stuck on teeth.<br />
You vanished in perimeters,<br />
clogged areas of strangers.<br />
I winced, summoning thoughts<br />
like, &ldquo;what is the square root<br />
of twelve hundred nine,?&rdquo; the date<br />
on which we met, or &ldquo;how to measure<br />
the tiny round seed which, sprouting,<br />
made love to our doom?&rdquo;<br />
A yellow isosceles lit the ground;<br />
I bisected it bitterly, thinking,<br />
love must be amorphous,<br />
like water, like white doilied foam &ndash;<br />
can only be contained only by<br />
huge polygonal stone.<br />
I sensed the swing of your<br />
fleshy unclasped hand --<br />
a starfish from the ocean,<br />
that diamond we never swam.</p>
