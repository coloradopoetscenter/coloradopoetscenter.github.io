          <h1>Black  Flowers</h1>
          <p>            I have been to the prairie,  seen the trees' palsied branchings, downward-gropings, felt the savage sunshine  snatch our shadows, baking bald grounds cracked as ancient faces, seen sweet  primrose peek from gramma grass and sagebrush, and in the fields both far and  near, beheld black flowers on pale white stalks you said were yellow yucca  corpses, but which, to me, were perfect tulips, <br />
          dark as sin, and as  enchanting.</p>
          <p>I've seen the fields' long faces yawning  under a n infinite sky, the once-fecund<br />
            fruit trees with their puny offerings.  and felt other spoilings, like that   inside of you, a shattering like the crumbling buildings' windows,  cracked as fragile promises, yes, corroded as with you, but for your traipsing  me through thirsty fields laid bare, like naked women awaiting lovers to shower  them with blooms of any color, or blanket them with killing quilts of snow.</p>
          <p>The sad gazebo, trellises severed and  blown, scraggly vines adoring the stubborn<br />
            frame, I have seen all with you, our  eyes' admitting disparate ghosts, yet in many ways the same, –  have sensed land on land in the bleariness of  your eyes, in the hunching of your shoulders beneath a tattered robe, quivered  at the outdoors  that roughs us, the dust  that fills, the wind that whispers through our shells of desolations meted and  the ones we've left behind.</p>
          <p>I have groped through lily and copper  mallow with you whose once gay hair <br />
            hangs limp and gray, have touched the  dimples that now crease your cheek, <br />
            as you pass, a phantom, the desiccated  creek, and through rubble of amputated limbs, have marched plain on plain  whipped stoically by gusts in that terrifying terrain, as the tulips blackly  list beneath a heaven void of cloud – have seen you stroll the steppe like a  shroud among bones of sheep lost to coyote and coyote to thirst.</p>
          <p>Like you I drum the days until the  fissures and plains come to claim us<br />
            and we sprawl at last like huge black  flowers, with parched and puckered lips<br />
            when winter its freezing manna frees,  aching for springs we've lived to dream, <br />
            and dreamed to die, and died to see.</p>
