title: Julianza Shavin : Extrication


---


  <h1>Extrication</h1>  <p> And then, thinking only of escape, trapped, <br /> it seemed, tethered either to house, the demon<br /> of elusive sleep, or a suckling insatiable babe – <br /> like some animal circling its homefires of steel – <br />
<br /> recalling Bradbury's unhappy heroine, setting out<br /> determined, yet when loosed, utterly lost,  <br /> and Sexton, shredding her seams, doffing <br /> routine, then careening compass-less until...</p>  <p>and my own small freedom – to name my newborn<br /> anything, no dead left to elegize –<br /> appropriating just sumptuous sound – <br /> and oh, the release in that – </p>  <p>until it floated like a helmeted man <br /> on a broken rope, turning and tumbling <br /> in slow somersaults, relinquished<br /> to stars and darkness – </p>  <p>So it's clear why I'm here in the thick of it, <br /> the thin waxing wantonly wide.<br />  </p>
