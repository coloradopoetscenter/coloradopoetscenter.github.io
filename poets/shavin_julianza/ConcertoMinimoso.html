  <h1>Concerto Minimoso</h1>  <p><strong>  </strong><em>for my  father</em></p>  <p>You and I listening to Chopin,<br /> a quiver through us both,<br /> taken, staring,<br /> somewhat petit mal,<br /> (in retrospect), <br /> that descending chord,<br /> indelible cascade<br /> that didn't resolve to its tonic<br /> but instead, to the minor sixth,<br /> f minor:the everything of that.<br /> Years pass and again <br /> the deceptive cadence<br /> the master wrote, <br /> I heard, <br />  and you were. </p> <p><em> for  the late Sam Haddock</em></p>  <p>You  see how the teacher tenderly takes<br /> the  pink-slippered foot of the stick-thin kid<br /> and  places the toe on the calf<br /> of  the other leg, such that the bent knee<br /> and  foot form a little pink triangle.</p>  <p>The  teacher says, now lower your arm<br /> and  dangle your fingers, as though<br /> water  is dripping down and off the<br /> forefinger  -- yes, like that.<br /> The  girls practice their positions, </p>  <p>perform  rudimentary moves of the <br /> pirouette,  then have free time for<br /> improvisation,  abandoning their <br /> bodies  to the music, <br /> gossamer  skirts whirling. </p>  <p>And  then you recall the gray, thick<br /> ankles,  feet and toes of the other<br /> students  priming for performance, <br /> how  the wrinkled legs are yanked,<br /> huge  and heavy, bound by braided ropes,</p>  <p>bodies  slammed to the ground<br /> or  shocked into submissive march to a beat,<br /> taught  to sit like proper tea ladies on little<br /> on  little benches, and forced to contort,<br /> with  front feet atop the animal ahead,</p>  <p>as  the handler commands, <em>make 'em scream,</em><br /> <em>Scream!</em>using bull hooks and electric <br /> prods,  to override any residual nature,<br /> masking  the thunderous cries<br /> with  blaring music.</p>  <p>You  know the denial of nurture, <br /> the  shackling for half a year after birth,<br /> until  the struggle comes to an end,<br /> and  the lumbering from cage to ring<br /> to  cage for thirty years or more, begins.</p>  <p>The  aspiring ballerinas stretch<br /> their  spindly arms, up and up, rounding<br /> them,  sashaying side to side, mothers<br /> watching  the mirror intently, their<br /> eyes  alight with pride.</p>  <p>The  elephants, exhausted, filthy, <br /> are  back to ropes, chains and cement,<br /> broken  for one more day.<br /> Your  mind helplessly plays, replays,<br /> the  pastiche of beauty and brutality.</p>  <p>You  wonder if you should withhold<br /> money  from the teacher, all lessons<br /> from  the child, and, instead, send <br /> to  those fighting for decent treatment<br /> of unsightly sentient beasts.</p>  <p>Your  child is hungry, so you drive into<br /> a  circus of noise, honking, lights, knowing<br /> the  show must go on.  You proceed warily, <br /> gripping  the wheel like a barre, in search of  <br /> some  kind, any kind, of sustenance. </p>  <p><em>This poem was written after viewing a slide-show  compiled by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, based on photographs  of circus elephant, taken by animal-handler-turned-undercover filmmaker Sam  Haddock.</em><br />  </p>
