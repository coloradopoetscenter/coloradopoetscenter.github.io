<h1>&quot;Niggers&quot; of Poland</h1>
<p>We were the niggers of Poland<br />
pearl skin hiding hearts<br />
dark and squalid --<br />
the ovens charred us clean.</p>
<p>The ovens charred us clean,<br />women, children<br />frantic, freezing<br />  flailing after breathing.</p>
<p>Frantic, freezing,<br />thrusting children up as though<br />to heaven not a ceiling<br />  alien air heaving.</p>
<p>Thrusting children up, then<br />collapsed, sprawled:<br />extinguished families of night<br />  sleeping swastikas all.</p>
