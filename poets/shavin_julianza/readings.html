              <h1>Readings</h1>
              <p>I am available for workshops, yes -- I  adore doing readings and read whenever I can, and enjoy that with others or  solo.&nbsp; I LOVE to bring poetry to the  public.&nbsp; I have also given workshops in  the schools, and am looking to expand on that.&nbsp;  I've only hostessed one slam, but I did a pretty good job, I think.&nbsp; I also love collaborating with other artists  with other art forms (dance, music, etc.).</p>
