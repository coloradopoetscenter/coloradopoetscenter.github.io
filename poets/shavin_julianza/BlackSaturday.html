              <h1>Black Saturday </h1>
              <p><strong>Homage/Ekphrasis to Mark Strand 1934-2014</strong></p>
              <p>Everything will be taken away<br />
                and still we greet the day.<br />
                What has happened will happen again<br />
                in houses, governments, fields.<br />
                The small room that is one's sanctuary<br />
                has no heartbeat but what one impales it with<br />
  <em>over, o, o-over.</em></p>
              <p>The Black Friday you took your near-last breaths, <br />
                I went to the mall to commune with other dead souls, <br />
                some storefronts of glass, dark-mirror dystopias.<br />
                But I could not hate them, nor the thriving.<br />
                Perhaps a child was battered by brain chemistry, <br />
                birth defect, a sclerosis, the wrist of a sick child<br />
                chained to the buying of baubles.<br />
                Let us bow our heads,<br />
                and buy.</p>
              <p>The mall is a nothing full of nothing<br />
                and everything. The fields, valleys, oceans. <br />
                That all things perish is not the problem it seems.<br />
                By that time, the storefront of soul<br />
                has clouded to beautiful fancy.<br />
                What happens out there - no scream is ever lost, <br />
                only transmuted, as in how, some ordinary Monday, <br />
                laughter gurgles into an infant<br />
                like bubbles of champagne.</p>
              <p>That the mall closes early feels tragic, mean,<br />
                all those chains dropping, locks snapping<br />
                by the afore-smiling. <br />
                I went to the mall to consort with other lost souls -<br />
                that other man whose death left me bereft <br />
                I searched for in wares, luggage, lingerie -&nbsp; <br />
                but a seeing-eye mannequin said <em>he is not here. </em><br />
  <em>No number of hearts in this octopus mall will do, </em><br />
  <em>an octopus is too smart to serve you.</em></p>
              <p>So I left, and today you expired like a credit card.<br />
                Except new ones come by mail, <br />
                except your words will fill empty places<br />
                in stealth, and with riches, <br />
                and with nothing we can name exactly, <br />
                and nothing we considered naming before.</p>
