  <h1>I Imagine my Friends Sleeping</h1>  <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>The 40-acre Man </strong><br /> <br /> Existing smoke to smoke<br /> he falls into a yellow sleep,<br /> fetal, fragile, <br /> limbs an exhausted toss<br /> of overlong pickup sticks, <br />
&nbsp;his  dreams small neon cities<br />
of occasional outages â€“ <br />
gunfire, ships, protracted or quick deaths<br />
stopovers for crack and snatch<br />
welts of a  childhood unseen unheard<br />
the rude wound of an only child <br />
swiped when six by the<br />
&nbsp;crazed and drunken mother<br />
and sometimes, the grave oasis<br />
of marriage to a good woman<br />
who slowly wasted<br />
whose care consumed all seconds<br />
though this too was love<br /><br />red and glowing like the fires<br />beneath the arcs beneath his eyes,<br />inhaled strongly, deeply<br />like the drowning must and do.<br /><br />He sleeps like a prairie sleeps<br />monarch of moonlight and stars<br />but with coyotes pricking the night <br />with their screams, <br />surging, insomniac, starved.</p>
