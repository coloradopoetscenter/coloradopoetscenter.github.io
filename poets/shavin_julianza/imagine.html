          <h1>I Imagine my Friends Sleeping</h1>
          <p>            <strong>1.</strong> <strong>The 40-acre Man </strong><br />
            <br />
            Existing smoke to smoke<br />
            he falls into a yellow sleep,<br />
            fetal, fragile, <br />
            limbs an exhausted toss<br />
            of overlong pickup sticks, <br />
&nbsp;his  dreams small neon cities<br />
of occasional outages – <br />
gunfire, ships, protracted or quick deaths<br />
stopovers for crack and snatch<br />
welts of a  childhood unseen unheard<br />
the rude wound of an only child <br />
swiped when six by the<br />
&nbsp;   crazed and drunken mother<br />
and sometimes, the grave oasis<br />
of marriage to a good woman<br />
who slowly wasted<br />
whose care consumed all seconds<br />
though this too was love<br />
  <br />
  red and glowing like the fires<br />
  beneath the arcs beneath his eyes,<br />
  inhaled strongly, deeply<br />
  like the drowning must and do.<br />
  <br />
  He sleeps like a prairie sleeps<br />
  monarch of moonlight and stars<br />
  but with coyotes pricking the night <br />
  with their screams, <br />
  surging, insomniac, starved.</p>
