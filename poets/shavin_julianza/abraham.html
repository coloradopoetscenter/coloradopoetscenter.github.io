<h1>Abraham</h1>
<p>Like hosannahs over Yahweh<br />
I hailed &quot;Used Yamaha!&rdquo;<br />
And you said &ldquo;yes yes!</p>
<p>Just whom do I pay?&rdquo;<br />But I was only joking,<br />having two keyboards already -<br />three would be decadence.<br />Perhaps it was a test<br />  my trying to make of you</p>
<p>some Abraham, to see what<br />
or whom you'd slay for me.<br />
I know it's not these things<br />
you want to purchase<br />
with passion's currency;<br />  it's me, but unfortunately</p>
<p>I'm not for sale, and cannot be.<br />So chase no gleaming keys<br />kill no kings or only-sons<br />part no seas or speak in tongues.<br />Love is enough; its proof resounds<br />  Leave that trembling boy unbound.</p>
