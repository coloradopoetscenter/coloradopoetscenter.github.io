              <p>Part 1: Mother</p>
              <p>When I go to bed nights,<br />
                I think of my mother.<br />
                She has the most beautiful sheets,<br />
                With roses and violets<br />
                on green swirling stems.<br />
                I fancy her legs slipping<br />
                into the cool cotton sheath,<br />
                and oh, how I've envied<br />
          the tranquil adieu!</p>
              <p>The truth is, my mother&rsquo;s legs are  blue,<br />
                varicosed and gnarled --<br />
                And a secret quarrel, until now.<br />
                She would deny being haunted,<br />
                resting thus alone,<br />
                my father dreaming elsewhere,<br />
                in a graveyard nearby,<br />
                his nocturnal symphonies silenced,<br />
          which once gave such grief.</p>
              <p>She always beds down fresh,<br />
                in frills too girlish for sixty,<br />
                but fantasies do so prevail.<br />
                Her legs, pampered in proportion<br />
                to their disappointment,<br />
                divine the kind caress,<br />
                and begin to feel heavy,<br />
                like the marble they are;<br />
                soon, even they are floating<br />
                as gently she tumbles,<br />
          like a fetus,</p>
              <p>a womb unto herself.<br />
                My mother is a ghost<br />
                in the garden of perfect selves.<br />
          She is a sandwich of flowers.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
