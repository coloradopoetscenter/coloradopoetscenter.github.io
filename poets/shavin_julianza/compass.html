<h1>Home Without a Compass</h1>
<p>Part 1: Mother</p>
<p>When I go to bed nights,<br />I think of my mother.<br />She has the most beautiful sheets,<br />With roses and violets<br />on green swirling stems.<br />I fancy her legs slipping<br />into the cool cotton sheath,<br />and oh, how I've envied<br />  the tranquil adieu!</p>
<p>The truth is, my mother&rsquo;s legs are  blue,<br />varicosed and gnarled --<br />And a secret quarrel, until now.<br />She would deny being haunted,<br />resting thus alone,<br />my father dreaming elsewhere,<br />in a graveyard nearby,<br />his nocturnal symphonies silenced,<br />  which once gave such grief.</p>
<p>She always beds down fresh,<br />in frills too girlish for sixty,<br />but fantasies do so prevail.<br />Her legs, pampered in proportion<br />to their disappointment,<br />divine the kind caress,<br />and begin to feel heavy,<br />like the marble they are;<br />soon, even they are floating<br />as gently she tumbles,<br />  like a fetus,</p>
<p>a womb unto herself.<br />My mother is a ghost<br />in the garden of perfect selves.<br />  She is a sandwich of flowers.</p>
