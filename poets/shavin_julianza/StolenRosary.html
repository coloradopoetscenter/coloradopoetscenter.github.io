         <h1>Stolen Rosary</h1> <p> So I rode the humble vanity of the damned, <br /> cradled in the dark corridor of that fractious <br /> affliction called Past, duel of the I versus I, <br /> caught in a net of farcical day, circumspect night. <br /> Sullen I, lusted for nothing, nothing! <br /> but some small everything, and that tryst <br /> evinced so opaque that I, neophyte, believed, <br /> and now – this riot of the five senses, of which <br /> fully four are free of sin – and everywhere, truth <br /> whoring about, jocular, and the sun, that sycophant, <br /> traipsing its grievous victory like some purloined rosary.  </p> <p>As child, I dreamed a bizarre orange world long before <br /> theory of color became a red passion, amber fire <br /> a blue thought, and white soul a black solace, funereal, <br /> with, always, that hideous happiness hacking me – <br /> until one day in a foreign land, an astounding arc of rainbow <br /> danced like benediction against the mountainside, and I <br /> ingested deeply the singular prism – exchanging a hale <br /> and alien trajectory for the fragile humanity of stone.  </p> <p>Though I sensed a predation of beauty upon beauty <br /> nearly too much to absorb, great clouds swarmed <br /> as a green sea gushing to drown the mountain in its gown, <br /> and that nectarine world evinced anew in the landmine<br /> of this aged and siphoned soul. <br /> Dreams lurid as shark-attack exhumed my shackled tears, <br /> still dripping of love and travesty, that eternal tapestry, <br /> but I, throbbing, translucent, like some inebriate fetus,<br /> became aware of a glaring opalescence advancing, <br /> ever advancing, the possibility of golden adagio gospelry. <br /> </p>
