          <h1>Commentary:</h1>
          <p>&ldquo;dance 101&rdquo; won the 2012 Colorado Authors League Award for Poetry. The judge  commented <em>This is an exceptionally well-written poem. It has a confident  rhythm and rich vowel sounds. There is a gentle, thoughtful intensity  throughout</em>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
          
          <p>On <em>Double exposure,</em> judge  Charles Cantalupo wrote: &ldquo;Beautifully conveying time and place, she meshes  scenes from childhood and adulthood, the relationship between father and  daughter juxtaposed with birth and death. The haunted imagery brings depth to  pain and fear, which transcends age and gender.&rdquo;</p>
