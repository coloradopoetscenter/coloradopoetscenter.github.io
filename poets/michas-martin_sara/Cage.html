          <h1>Cage </h1>
          <p>On one side of the world two men argue<br />
          over the placement of sticks as they lay a fire </p>
          <p>in the woods near the festival. The fire <br />
            attracts many people who shake to the sound </p>
          <p>of hands slapping drums. On the other side <br />
            kids unpack their water guns, their little  sacks of flour </p>
          <p>and build stupas out of sand in the river. <br />
            I sit in the hard dirt looking all around </p>
          <p>and try to be glad for one thing. But watch<br />
            a seated crowd from a distance</p>
          <p>notice how many people touch their faces, or  wave <br />
            their arms, as if to form one animal stuck </p>
          <p>on its back. Once a year it&rsquo;s tradition to  purchase <br />
            a tiny white bird in a wire cage, only to walk  a few feet </p>
          <p>and release it. I&rsquo;d be less restless <br />
            if I could, periodically, let one thing go—</p>
          <p>a spider inside a suitcase, the voice <br />
            of someone I despise. I could smile truthfully </p>
          <p>across a fire at someone with whom I may<br />
            never speak. If you and I ever meet, dear  stranger                                        </p>
          <p>on a bumpy train, in a car where we are forced <br />
            to face each other and become anxious</p>
          <p>enough to talk, let&rsquo;s talk frankly <br />
            and about uncommon things. <br />
            <br />
