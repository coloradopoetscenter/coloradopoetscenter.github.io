  <h1>Olfaction</h1>  <p>Heat  breaks against the city  rats canvass  garbage <br /> before  the sun livens the stench  overtaking steam<br /> from  the rusted waffle cart  the neighbor&rsquo;s  chain-smoke <br /> wafting  through the a/c  where I linger <br /> attempting  to daydream the temperature <br /> of  Lake Superior  trout swimming  vertically<br /> adrift  from natal streams<br /> that  smell for trace particles  to follow  home  to breed <br /> some  shared design of early human  before  our creature <br /> staggered  out of the ocean  breathing on  half-formed lungs<br /> testing  new measures of gravity  brain  sprouting <br /> around  the olfactory bulb  it&rsquo;s impossible <br /> to  name directly  a scent that opens on you <br /> like  a fire alarm  carrot yanked clear out  of the ground <br /> or  the whisper you inhale  from a few  rooms over <br /> to  confirm nothing is burning  no  poisonous vapor <br /> not  your nerves in bloom  like years  ago  the swim meets<br /> how  I shook on the starting block  the  smell of chlorine <br /> a  kind of scar on the limbic target  which lives <br /> where  memory lives  and why I recall  <br /> in  the after burn of matches  a lover  mid-day  <br /> lighting  a candle  the window closed on a mower<br /> the  tone at his neck  something like  bleach and grass <br /> which  calmed me  the way gas fumes can <br /> coasting  into a station  those lost miles <br /> en  route to upper Michigan  where the sky <br /> claims  enormous real estate  and I drive into  it  <br /> on  the wind  barely the mention of  cattle.  </p>
