  <h1>I Can't Stop Thinking About the Dog </h1>  <p>Tied up and beaten  as a puppy –<br /> finally rescued, <br /> he&rsquo;d lay his large  head<br /> in his owner&rsquo;s lap<br />  and lick the  children&rsquo;s faces.</p>  <p>Only to be stolen,<br /> tied to a speeding  truck and<br /> hauled up a hill,  running until<br /> his long legs at  last gave out <br /> – dragged to death.</p>  <p>I rage, imagining  the awful ways<br /> I would punish this  man.<br /> There it is –<br /> the very same  capacity for cruelty<br /> within me.</p>  <p>And so I remember  Gary<br /> on death row, and  know<br /> this man too must  have his story,<br /> and how nothing rescued  him<br /> from this repeating  –<br />  </p>  <p>no inborn trait of  alchemy<br /> that turns cruelty  into kindness,<br /> no concerned look  of a stranger,<br /> no glimpse of  another way<br /> to be in the world.<br /> (<strong><em>Plainsongs</em>)</strong></p>
