  <h1>And Why Not? </h1>  <p>Sitting in a café,  I overhear a small girl ask,<br />  <em>how old are the souls in heaven?</em></p>  <p>Her grandmother  does not answer directly,<br /> thinks heaven must  be like home once was<br /> with all the  furniture, photographs, and dishes<br /> restored to their  proper places.  I imagine</p>  <p>that fellow across  the way, doodling on a napkin,<br /> sees heaven painted  by Van Gogh&rsquo;s ghost<br /> in thick layers of  red, blue and yellow,<br /> ever-fresh  sunflowers and irises blooming.</p>  <p>And the scientific  sort in the corner<br /> would say there is  no such thing<br /> as time&rsquo;s fractured  clock<br /> in eternity.  Can my father be</p>  <p>both the brash  American soldier<br /> my mother fell for<br /> and the forty-year  old doctor<br /> he was when he  died?</p>  <p>I wonder if he  could be one age<br /> in her heaven and  another in mine<br /> and if I might  visit hers<br /> and not intrude or  seem a stranger.</p>  <p>Surely heaven holds  no such dilemmas.<br /> And so a girl might  think of<br /> heaven as a place  where souls<br /> embrace without  arms, smile without faces, </p>  <p>sing without  tongues –<br /> known by their  essence in our own <br /> ephemeral hearts.<br /> <em>  (<strong>Slant</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p>
