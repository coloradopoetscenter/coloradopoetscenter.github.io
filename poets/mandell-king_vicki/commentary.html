          <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          <p>By  turns graceful and fierce, Vicki Mandell-King&rsquo;s poems hold to &ldquo;the sharp edge  of things,&rdquo; the edge that can join and separate and cut.  <em>Tenacity  of Lace</em> traverses the full range of grief and loss—the inescapable  fragility of &ldquo;our own ephemeral hearts&rdquo;—but it does so in poems that are  vibrant, tenacious, made to last. </p>
          <p> John Brehm, author of <em>Help Is on the Way</em></p>
          <p>By turns celebratory, elegiac, joyous, and heartbroken, Vicki  Mandell-King&rsquo;s poems in <em> Tenacity of  Lace</em> offer a full exploration of human experience. Mandell-King populates  her poems with a memorable cast – a death-row killer, war hero, crippled  ballerina, overdosed heroin addict, orphaned daughter, expectant mother, and  many others whose interconnected lives reveal truths about love, beauty, loss,  and letting go. Through these lyric poems, Mandell-King transforms the stuff of  life into a balm of wisdom.</p>
          <p>Amy Riddell, author of <em>Bullet  in the Jewelry Box</em></p>
          <p>These are intimate poems like memoir or the way we come to know a  friend. <em>Tenacity of Lace </em>swirls and leaps with startling connections and  contrast, reflection and refraction—of mother, husband, son, of cruelty and  kindness, of loss and love. In rhythms of their own, the poems seem to have  carved themselves, as Vicki tells the bare bones, touching upon joy, opening to  darkness, never harsh but undaunted. </p>
          <p> Carolyn  Jennings, author of <em>Hunger Speaks: A Memoir Told in Poetry</em></p>
          <p>In each of these brilliantly crafted poems, Mandell-King reveals the  paradox embedded in her title of a tenacious daughter who lost her war hero  father as a young child, and a compassionate Federal Public Defender holding  hands with a killer before his execution. Over and over, she puts &quot;flesh  on these bare-boned words,&quot; takes up &quot;the sweet knot of my life's  untangling,&quot; listens &quot;for the authentic voice/blown in the glass of a  bull's eye.&quot; Under much loss and pain, she spreads the white lace of her  words.</p>
