  <h1>Biography</h1>  <p>Vicki Mandell-King has been writing poetry for what seems most of  her life. She intended to do so as a career, but in 1970, a stranger on an  airplane observed, &ldquo;It seems like you want to change the world.  How about law school?&rdquo;  That random remark led to a 30-year career as  an Assistant Federal Public Defender.But Vicki has never stopped writing poetry.As she says, she writes  &ldquo;to get to the bottom of things, to surprise  herself.&rdquo;  Vicki's poetry has been  individually published in a variety of literary journals, and her first book of  poems is called TENACITY OF LACE. She and her husband live in an old,  continuously-remodeled Victorian near the foothills of the Rockies. Their son  and family live close by. </p>
