          <h1>In Transition</h1>
          <p>I imagine the labored  breathing, the urge to push, <br />
          contractions that  come harder, faster.  Trembling, </p>
          <p>hot and cold, legs  shaking.  The midwife <br />
            whispering, <em>the baby is almost here.</em></p>
          <p>I come to know the  cut of a sterile knife<br />
            when this body did  no more than obey</p>
          <p>a silent wish to  hold him close to the bone,<br />
            when he was early  ready to enter the world.</p>
          <p>Awakened from a  dream to the possibility<br />
            of something simply  different,</p>
          <p>readying for the  radical.<br />
            After all, everyone  and everything moves on,</p>
          <p> (<em>Illya&rsquo;s Honey</em>)</p>
