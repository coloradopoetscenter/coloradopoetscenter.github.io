  <h1>In Transition</h1>  <p>I imagine the labored  breathing, the urge to push, <br />  contractions that  come harder, faster.  Trembling, </p>  <p>hot and cold, legs  shaking.  The midwife <br /> whispering, <em>the baby is almost here.</em></p>  <p>I come to know the  cut of a sterile knife<br /> when this body did  no more than obey</p>  <p>a silent wish to  hold him close to the bone,<br /> when he was early  ready to enter the world.</p>  <p>Awakened from a  dream to the possibility<br /> of something simply  different,</p>  <p>readying for the  radical.<br /> After all, everyone  and everything moves on,</p>  <p> (<em>Illya&rsquo;s Honey</em>)</p>
