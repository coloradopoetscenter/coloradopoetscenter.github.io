  <h1>Tutoring Tanya and Jessica </h1>  <p>These are two affable intelligent Chicana students<br />  in their first year at the university.<br />  They are hungry for knowledge.<br />  They want to know what words<br />  like <em>procurement </em>and <em>innovation</em> mean.<br />I am tutoring them in political  science.</p>  <p> We meet once a week<br /> in the dorm complex commons at  Williams Village.<br /> We relax on a loveseat and easy  chairs<br />  around a large round end table.<br /> It is the kind of furniture you  might<br /> expect to find in any American  home.</p>  <p>Jessica sits on my left. Jessica  is summer.<br />  Tanya sits on my right. Tanya is  winter.<br />  It is a balmy spring evening.<br />  Jessica is wearing a hot  cinnamon<br />  candy red sweatshirt turned  inside out<br />with matching red lipstick and nail  polish.</p>  <p> She is wearing blue jean  cutoffs and slouches back<br /> with her feet on the table, her red socks and long legs.<br /> Tanya is dressed in aquamarine mountain mint socks<br />  matching plaid and white shorts  and solid tee shirt.<br /> Her feet are up  in the chair, her knees up, her legs apart.<br /> She gently rubs  the skin under the left thigh</p>  <p>with her  fingertips and pink nails,<br />  then she plays with her  beautiful brown hair.<br />  We have a lively discussion on  how to<br />  re-invent government how to save  money<br />  by one-stop shopping like  putting voter registration<br />in the same  place we go for a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>  <p> We discuss re-inventing  financial aid for students.<br /> We laugh  a lot. The both have beautiful brown eyes<br /> that  glisten when they smile, and long brown hair.<br />  Best friends since fifth grade,  although taking poly sci<br /> was  accidental, they tell me they do everything together.<br /> I am a  timber wolf lost in the wilderness. </p>  <p>(<em>The South Carolina Review</em>)</p>
