  <h1>One Year of Grace </h1>  <p>try to imagine<br /> one year of grace<br /> one perfect day after another</p>  <p>in a house where dust<br /> does not collect behind walls<br /> and the corners are free from webs</p>  <p>when you enter here take off your  shoes<br /> the floors are made of gold<br /> hidden in the carpenter&rsquo;s truth</p>  <p>for we are gifted<br /> with felicity of<br /> place of solitude</p>  <p>&amp; friends<br /> and what we store<br /> in memory</p>  <p>and I think<br /> with patience<br /> and with kindness<br /> what is possible becomes new</p>  <p> (<em>1984 Coloradan Poetry Award</em>)</p>
