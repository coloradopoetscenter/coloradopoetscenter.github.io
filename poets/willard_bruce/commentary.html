          <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          <p>In Holding Ground  the poet touches the world and senses nuances in the  
            terrain of what lives in  the heart and in the mind. In a simple eloquence,  
            Willard&rsquo;s poems  articulate ordinary and difficult moments to strike  
            the genuine pitch of what  it means to be fully alive. The poet celebrates  
            our possibilities even as  he knows our lives are filled with all the spirit&rsquo;s  
            dangers. The poems are  clear and evocative, an elegant accomplishment.

          <p>Bruce Willard writes with balanced—and earned—accuracy from  the heart  
            of his experience. The natural world is not, for him, an  image &lsquo;kitty,&rsquo; but a  
            powerful real presence that through its resistances, as well  as its vexing beauty,  
            marks out the reach of inwardness. The poems are clear  windows on the defining scenes of that inwardness: love, separation, family,  and coming to terms with pain and joy.&rdquo;  
            —Sven Birkerts </p>
          <p>&lsquo;Lord, give me what you&rsquo;ve already given / Until I unbelieve  it  
            so thoroughly / I believe again.&rsquo; Holding Ground finds a man at the  
            crossroads of his life where music, memory, and desire  converge, the  
            torn self at the root. These quietly powerful poems are the  thoughts  
            and visions of a man broken open, moving forward past  exhaustion,  
            who endures his own heart as the seasons unfold around him  and the  
            tides shift at his feet, staying the course, holding ground.
