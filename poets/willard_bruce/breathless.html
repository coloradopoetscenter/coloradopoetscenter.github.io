          <h1>Breathless</h1>
          <p>This morning, minus 12  degrees,<br />
            the furnace&rsquo;s exhaust  almost vertical,<br />
            high as the Spruce beside  the house –<br />
            mouthy, moist braid of  cumulous giving up <br />
          as little as possible to a  dry and navy sky.</p>
          <p>This morning, all things  close-held.<br />
            Not a bird on the suet  feeder. <br />
            No sign of plow or trash or cable<br />
            Truck. Not even the small dog <br />
            Retreats to the house next door.</p>
          <p>This morning, I am thankful for all  that remains – <br />
            the holidays, closed and almost out of view, <br />
            some large flurries floating past the window,<br />
            the moisture held up in small, buffered drifts <br />
            Between each pane.</p>
