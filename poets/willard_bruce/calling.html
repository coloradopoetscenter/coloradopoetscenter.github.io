  <h1>The Calling</h1>  <p>Sometimes at dusk when the  earth gives its sweet breath to the trees,<br /> I think how I have taken a  stranger's life and whispered not<br />  so much as his name to the  asphalt sky.</p>  <p>How each year, on my mother's  birthday, I hear the warbled rasp<br /> of his breathing and it  pushes and draws me like a blues harp<br /> soaked in whiskey from  which the bent yawl of reeds<br /> becomes the song I have to  play.</p>  <p>Biking that night, decades  ago, I felt the desert wind coming over <br /> the ridge<br /> meeting the November  valley air, spermy smell of fennel <br /> and ceanothus,<br /> past the oak and  Manzanita, past the cereus and chaparral grass,<br /> past the cornering lanes,  past the houses I mistook for home,<br /> past the church at Mt  Carmel with its weathered perfection.</p>  <p>If I was drawn to him, no  line was visible. There were no lines.<br /> Just a mountain road,  uphill tick of my pedaling,<br /> and his downhill whir of  speed, the sound of his nylon jacket <br /> flapping,<br /> then click of handlebars,  crush of steel and skull.</p>  <p>Beside the road where we  lay, an owl called. Listen,<br /> I thought. And I heard how  its voice survives each question,<br /> how each question survives  the shadow of clouds.<br /> And I called to my  stranger that I might hear his voice,<br /> knowing not even his name.  I called to him and he became<br /> to me like wind on a flag  pole, wind in a tree,<br /> something moving that  cannot be moved.</p>  <p><em>(Ploughshares, Spring 2013, all rights reserved</em>)</p>
