<h1>Men, Retiring into the Mountains, A Muse Themselves</h1>
<p>Gathering around coffee cups, we  sometimes talk<br />
of hunting, where and what, how  far, how much,<br />
or history, the Old Someone Place.  The subject</p>
<p>for yesterday was the wind, and  how<br />it can do any thing it wants. </p>
<p>Today it becomes accidents. &ldquo;So  I&rsquo;d put<br />the mower blade back  up-side-down--&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&ldquo;I figured the rope would hold for  a while because&mdash;&ldquo; </p>
<p>Outside the birds are singing in  Chinese,<br />wars in the old capital, wars on  the borders.</p>
<p>Outside, the sun, which we  remember, continues.<br />Another man begins, &ldquo;The ladder  wouldn&rsquo;t reach<br />  so I backed my pickup up to the  house&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Outside, white clouds pass all  day.<br />We are wise, or old. We can afford  to laugh.</p>
