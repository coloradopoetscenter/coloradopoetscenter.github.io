<h1>The Maps</h1>
<p>On the wall of the coffee shop is a map of the world<br />with all the countries coffee comes from brightly colored,<br />
and the names&mdash;Tanzania, Malawi, Tonga. Jamaica&mdash;<br />
in white letters bobbing just offshore on the blue-green sea.</p>
<p>In the bread store there must be a map of the world<br />showing where various wheats and barleys arise<br />and in the natural history museum a map of dinosaurs&rsquo;<br />buried locations, one frequently consulted by geologists.</p>
<p>In the hospital, there&rsquo;s a map where plagues are pins<br />or blinking lights, and in the marriage store<br />a map, with local inserts, showing where your future<br />husband or wife now lives. There&rsquo;s also a map,</p>
<p>you should understand, in the divorce store.<br />In the church there&rsquo;s a map of the various local<br />manifestations of God which changes periodically<br />when a statue exudes red liquid or drinks milk.</p>
<p>In the chair store there&rsquo;s a map showing the location<br />of all the chairs in the world. This map is always<br />changing as people get up from a table and move them,<br />or someone is asked to sit down or someone arrives.</p>
<p>In Orlando, Florida, someone is setting up chairs<br />in a hotel ballroom for a convention. In Paris,<br />a chair unaccountably tumbles from a truck<br />and lands upside down beside the Seine,</p>
<p>a small surrealist object glowing all night.<br />In Ogden, Iowa, a chair sits at the kitchen table,<br />unmoved for two years, the dead brother&rsquo;s jacket<br />draped over it, still too heavy to be lifted up. </p>
<p>In the sleeping store, there&rsquo;s a map of all the countries<br />where people are asleep, which looks like any map,<br />a cheap reprint, though probably quite accurate,<br />and which closely resembles the map in the dying store. </p>
