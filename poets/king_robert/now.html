              <h1>Now</h1>
              <p>I shuffle on snowshoes through the  pines<br />
in last night&rsquo;s snow--so where I  am </p>
              <p>was not here yesterday--and arrive<br />
                at a rocky creek, ice tightened <br />
          over the chatter of secret water.</p>
              <p>Earlier I knew every question, <br />
                my name was &ldquo;He-Who-Answers-Himself.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Now I am only whatever listens,<br />
                whatever sees what&rsquo;s hidden below <br />
          and everything hidden above.</p>
              <p>Now I am breaking, coming  together.<br />
                I am so alive I have forgotten my  life. </p>
