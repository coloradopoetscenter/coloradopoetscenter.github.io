<h1>Examination</h1>
<p>It is science to see my father&rsquo;s  skull&mdash;<br />
as he lies in the dim machine next  door&mdash;<br />
on a screen, faint white, vague  black, a pot<br />
of thoughts, whether broken or  not, the question,</p>
<p>and another science to see my  father&rsquo;s skull,<br />an X-ray of the grave, the bare  old bone<br />of everyone, jaw&rsquo;s jut, the  forehead&rsquo;s curve,<br />  the dark rounds that hold eyes  seeing, or not.</p>
<p>He follows orders not to move. I  barely<br />move myself. I shouldn&rsquo;t be seeing  this.<br />I can&rsquo;t stop looking. This could  be<br />  a thousand-year-old find in a  sandy cave,</p>
<p>the plates and fissures of our  last design.,<br />a round home held in the hands and  turned,<br />the singular museum of memories<br />  gone hollow, dry in the driest  air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wendell, wake up,&rdquo; the technician  murmurs<br />into a microphone. He needs him  awake.<br />The son, too, needs him awake,  wanting<br />  to see that unique familiar mask</p>
<p>pulled back over the general  stone,<br />the temporary look a long time  loved.<br />&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he murmurs back, the soft  wet eyes,<br />  which I can&rsquo;t see on this machine,  now opening. </p>
