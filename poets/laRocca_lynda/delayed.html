  <h1>Delayed Gratification</h1>  <p> by Lynda La Rocca </p>  <p>I once was happy at your side, but now<br /> it’s over and past time for me to go.<br /> I never did imagine that our vow<br /> would bind you to me, still, it was a blow<br /> to learn your roving eye had fixed upon<br /> (for friends are ever eager to report)<br /> a younger version of myself, a swan,<br /> whose feathery, soft limbs give greater sport.<br /> And so she joins your clutch of wounded doves,<br /> to flutter on your arm until the time<br /> you choose to shelve her, too, with former loves,<br /> and add another victim to your crime.<br /> There is no justice in this world, it’s true—<br />  but in the next God waits, She waits for you. </p>  <p><strong>Acknowledgment</strong>:<br />  This Shakespearean sonnet was originally published in  Lynda’s second poetry chapbook, <em>The Stillness Between</em>.</p>
