          <h1>You Know Who You Are</h1>
          <p> by Lynda La Rocca</p>
          <p>There’s no one home and nothing here, this place<br />
            is silent as a night without its star.<br />
            How could they all have vanished with no trace—<br />
            and why will no one tell me where they are?<br />
            If gone indeed, they surely travel far<br />
            to hide themselves.   The strong become the weak<br />
          and flee from those who would insist they speak</p>
          <p>at least one truth where lies have lingered long.<br />
            The pain that stops the heart and sears the throat<br />
            is captured in the whisper of this song.<br />
            No dwelling, be it ever so remote,<br />
            can shelter them or shield them from each note<br />
            that I will raise, its echoes soft but clear,<br />
            to make them quake and shiver in their fear. </p>
          <p>Where have you gone, you cowards, faithless fools?<br />
            Why suddenly do you appear afraid,<br />
            who still would barter dignity for rules,<br />
            who threaten, terrify, to be obeyed,<br />
            not once remembering the price was paid<br />
            in silence, tears, in secrets hidden deep,<br />
            that I was forced to worship and to keep.</p>
          <p>No longer will I live in thrall to those<br />
            who tricked me into thinking it was right<br />
            to clasp the thorn and throw away the rose,<br />
            to seek no solace, much less seek delight,<br />
            to shun the sun and blot out all that’s bright.<br />
            So now I break these bonds that held me fast<br />
            and need no longer deify the past.</p>
          <p>And though you can’t embrace me, I forgive<br />
            the wasted years, the coldness, and the pride<br />
            that turned each joy into a negative<br />
            and openly rejoiced at all that died.<br />
            I now declare you’ve no more need to hide.<br />
            Come back, go forth, it’s all the same to me.<br />
            Releasing you, I find that I am free.          </p>
