          <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          <h3>Commentary by Veronica Patterson on <em><a href="visiting.html">The Visiting Hour</a></em></h3>
          <p>          “Poems often arrest and illuminate a brief moment.  One strength of “The Visiting Hour” is the  way it explores a human encounter with resourcefulness and integrity, moving  fluidly between image (“melting away like a thaw . . .”) and statement (“Today,  his own hands surprise him . . .”).  . .  . The poem’s ending captures a moment that both closes and opens the poem.  It offers a sense of spring that arises not  from flowers but a flowered curtain, in lines that accomplish what poet Stephen  Dunn calls “bringing the strange home.”    . . . “The Visiting Hour” resonates by creating a magnifying lens  through which we see one thread of the human story.” </p>
          <h3>Commentary by Viktor Tichy on <em><a href="youKnow.html">You Know Who You Are</a></em></h3>
          <p>“The  subject, shrouded in mystery on first reading, prompts re-reading; prominent heartbeat  of the iambic meter throughout the poem which grows on the reader.”</p>
          <h3>Additional commentary on Lynda La Rocca’s first poetry  chapbook <em>In the Shortness of</em> <em>My Days</em>, from review by Martha  Quillen, co-founder and co-editor of <em>Colorado Central</em> <em>Magazine</em> (May 1994 <em>Colorado Central Magazine</em>, Salida, Colorado):</h3>
          <p>“. . . La Rocca is a very competent poet . . . there should  be many books to follow—because La Rocca writes exceptionally well.”  </p>
