Box 28<br /> Twin Lakes, CO  81251<br /> 719-486-2285 (phone/fax)<br /><a href="mailto:llsv@amigo.net">llsv@amigo.net</a></p>  <p>I enjoy presenting my poetry to the public and am available  for readings and workshops.  I would also  happily visit schools to talk about poetry and the poetic process and work with  students of all ages who are interested in writing their own poetry.</p>  <p>My work schedule and the time and expense involved in  traveling to various locations throughout the state make it necessary to  request that anyone interested in scheduling me for an appearance be willing to  discuss covering my basic travel expenses and providing a nominal stipend.</p>
