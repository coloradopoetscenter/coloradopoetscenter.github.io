          <h1>The Visiting Hour</h1>
          <p> by Lynda La Rocca                                                                            </p>
          <p>He is vanishing before my eyes.<br />
            Muscle, tissue, sinew, skin<br />
            melting away like a thaw <br />
            that knows no hope of spring.<br />
            Today, his own hands surprise him—<br />
            flesh not of his body,<br />
            he cannot remember <br />
            what illness caused this pain,<br />
            nor whose fingers these are<br />
            that have curled and cramped <br />
            against his own dry palm.<br />
            Circling the room,<br />
            he paces without purpose,<br />
            this captive who has forgotten<br />
            the feel of sun,<br />
            the look of sky and moon and star,<br />
            who has forgotten the names of days,<br />
            afraid of his reflection <br />
            when they come to shave him,<br />
            the mirror gleaming on his bony skull.</p>
          <p>“This is the newest model.<br />
            I can get it up to 90 in less than a minute, and it runs so  smooth,”<br />
            he declares, mistaking his own steel-railed bed<br />
            for the sports car that he only drove for show one  afternoon,  <br />
            pretending to the ladies it was his.<br />
            He cannot remember his favorite color,<br />
            why he raged at the untrimmed hedge,<br />
            how he took his coffee,<br />
            if his wife had ever loved him.<br />
            But this dark chocolate ice cream on the tongue,<br />
            now this is something.<br />
            Sweet and smooth<br />
            smooth and sweet,<br />
            it stirs a strange awakening.<br />
            Two spoonfuls and his throat is closed again.<br />
            “Here,” he whispers, pushing the dish to me.<br />
            “I’m getting so bad.”  <br />
            Chin drooping to chest,<br />
            he stares at the floor, <br />
            seeing ants where none are crawling.<br />
            I kiss his one good hand.<br />
            “Come on,” I say.   “Let’s take a walk.”</p>
          <p>In the hall, floor tiles shiny, disinfectant, <br />
            metal cart clustered <br />
            with plastic cups of applesauce and powdered pills.<br />
            “Look there,” he suddenly shouts, <br />
            pointing with that one good hand to a flowered window  curtain. <br />
          “The crocuses, they’re early this year.”</p>
          <p>And for an instant then, he smiles.          </p>
