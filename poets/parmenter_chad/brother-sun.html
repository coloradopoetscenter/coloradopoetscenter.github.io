<h1> Prayer to My Brother in the Sun </h1>
<p>  In nineteen ninety-three, with me sixteen, </p>
<p> you&rsquo;re god, at least his priest, out on the lawn. </p>
<p> Your robes are Polo shorts and muscles full </p>
<p> of iron, and your eardrums shot by Guns </p>
<p> &lsquo;n Roses. Headphones, on their halo, pin </p>
<p> peroxide-golden spikes against your scalp, </p>
<p> and sacred Raybans plate your eyes with night </p>
<p> to shrink and twin the sun to stars of ice. </p>
<p> An alloy, sweat and molten Coppertone, </p>
<p> converts your face into a smelted mask, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> the frown as proud as Terminator&rsquo;s when </p>
<p> he walks through Armageddon, tan intact. </p>
<p> In fact, I think you&rsquo;d be a Kennedy </p>
<p> if destiny had taste, and, if I had </p>
<p> my way, you&rsquo;d stay outside, let sunset plate </p>
<p> your chest with all the gems that armored priests </p>
<p> of Exodus. You&rsquo;ll melt tonight to dawn&rsquo;s </p>
<p> zirconium and turquoise, shine like ice, </p>
<p> that summer diamond. Our suburban i- </p>
<p> con, shine as high as you can stand it. Blaze </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> away the night that blinds the windowpanes. </p>
<p> You&rsquo;ll bind the moon into its nautilus </p>
<p> of thoughts. Stay out, and winter, when it comes, </p>
<p> will run into the heat wave that the songs </p>
<p> have promised. Comet, better yet, the best </p>
<p> Apollo spaceship made, you&rsquo;ll rise by fire </p>
<p> and use the booster rockets in your booze </p>
<p> to flare into the stratosphere and tear </p>
<p> the ozone open. There, you&rsquo;ll flare so bright, </p>
<p> the ultraviolet eye that radiates </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> on all of us will close. It won&rsquo;t. I know. </p>
<p> I call you in to dinner, parents, prayer </p>
<p> too soon. You fly into a dozen years </p>
<p> of heat and hurt. Then, older, sober, paled </p>
<p>by God, you leave me cold. Amen. Come in. </p>
