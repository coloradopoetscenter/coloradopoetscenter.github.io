              <h1> Batman&rsquo;s Backlash at Catwoman&rsquo;s Come-On </h1>
              <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>When sirens die, they turn into your purr. </p>
              <p> I scan the scene of the cat burglary </p>
              <p> and find a thigh in violet naugahyde </p>
              <p> protruding like a whisker from a door. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> You wanted me to find you. Was it for </p>
              <p> this kiss? Your tongue is plunging perjury </p>
              <p> into my mouth. Just once, I let it lie, </p>
              <p> and pet the suit, too smooth to call your fur. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> But when you curl your whip around my wrist </p>
              <p> to pull against your zipper&rsquo;s silver smile, </p>
              <p> I jerk it back, because our nakedness </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> is this. Your suit is you, as I am mine, </p>
              <p> and making love, to us, will stay a chase. </p>
              <p> So pet me one more time, my prey, then run. </p>
