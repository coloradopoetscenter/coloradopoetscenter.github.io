              <h1> Batman In Honey Again </h1>
              <p> After a hive&rsquo;s worth of hurt lovers, you said <em>No more. </em></p>
              <p class="indent"><em> There&rsquo;s no higher crime to fight than my desire.</em> Holy utility belt; </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> it held a cold shower. When you rescued the brunette </p>
              <p class="indent"> who only wore tears of gratitude, it came in handy, wept you </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>empty. No lust in the buzzing months of spring. But </p>
              <p class="indent"> they uncoiled so slowly, like royal jelly, and your mind, hive </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> to light, went out. But not for long. Many stone combs </p>
              <p class="indent"> radiate from your cave. A waif came in, runaway, orphaned </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> as a sphere of sugary air in honey. Hot as pollen. Not </p>
              <p class="indent"> again. Ignore her pheromone when it sweetens your den. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> Go deaf to the flutter of her mustard-colored skirt, </p>
              <p class="indent"> the buzz of its zipper. Hide your eyes from its glisten, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> the exoskeleton of her yellow jacket, the bra&rsquo;s black </p>
              <p class="indent"> vector on your wax Tyrannosaur. No pollen-golden socks </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> kick and lick in its claws. No, don&rsquo;t buzz up. Oh, but </p>
              <p class="indent"> you must. Sticky with mystique, tattooed with bat shadows, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> she sees you. Go, drone again. Honey drowns the scene. </p>
              <p class="indent"> Later, it will caramelize to memories. Too Hornet-Green </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> with afterglow to take her home or even ask her name, </p>
              <p class="indent"> let her flutter here. You, tremble-dance in your swarm </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> of criminals. In the sonar of this romance, they shimmer </p>
              <p class="indent"> amber. Now, the bee-eye moon clouds over. Omen. Get home. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> Honey Nameless swarms your most personal of arsenals, </p>
              <p class="indent"> unveils the worst of your souvenirs. From the Riddler&rsquo;s carnival, </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> that candy medusa head. It squints. Oh, no. As you zoom in, </p>
              <p class="indent"> she turns way too glittery and white. In the sugar stare </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> she petrifies. Her last word sparkles in the bitter air: <em>lover</em>. </p>
              <p class="indent"> Search your flower heart for a nectar cure. If, like her, </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> it&rsquo;s too sweet to be real, then mourn. Then begin again. You can.</p>
