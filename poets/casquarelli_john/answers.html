        <h1>answers move the silt downstream </h1>
        <p>this highway is beat-up concrete we pass at eight-thirty cool  morning toward the Dakotas <br />
          free of billboards and advertisements and you say &ldquo;Go away, I&rsquo;m  seeking truth.&rdquo; <br />
          so we drive on <br />
          puzzled <br />
          willing to get lost in some farmer&rsquo;s backyard <br />
          discuss memories, birth control, <br />
          and I confess to being an unfeeling, ignorant clod, a sort of  trousered ape to whom it is obviously a waste of time to take an interest in  anything higher than Lady Gaga's underwear <br />
          isn&rsquo;t it enough to know the engine is flooded? <br />
          but, of course, that&rsquo;s technology <br />
          it&rsquo;s so simple when you see it <br />
          barbed-wire fences <br />
          locked gates <br />
          signs that say NO TRESPASSING <br />
          fewer trees and a sudden feeling of being a spectator amid the  rattles near cottonwoods </p>
        <p align="right"> after a while we  whisper to mountain sunlight <br />
          run down each other&rsquo;s  ghosts <br />
          move to the bed by the  window <br />
          I read  a sentence or two from an old butterfly journal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
          afraid  that voices will be silent if I let them &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
          as soon as the wind  stops <br />
          we rest our heads on  the sleeve of my jacket <br />
          think of the empty road  in the photograph <br />
  &ldquo;Is  there anything more,&rdquo; you ask, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  &ldquo;besides  one tiny refuge of scrub pines and mosquito repellent?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
          familiarity makes it hard  to see <br />
          past shady curbstone  behind hotel <br />
          where you can throw a  penny onto a small green plain <br />
          reach some temporary  goal <br />
          that explains how much  better it is to travel <br />
          than to arrive </p>
