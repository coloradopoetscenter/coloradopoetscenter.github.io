        <h1>Tribute to an Upper West Side Evening </h1>
        <p><em>for Inna</em></p>
        <p>somewhere there must be a road that <br />
          leads away from muffled voices &amp; </p>
        <p>buses blowing smoke &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a place where <br />
          we hear the ocean&rsquo;s whisper &amp; the </p>
        <p>rustle of palm trees &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether from <br />
          lust or imaginable tomorrows </p>
        <p>becoming new with the waves <br />
          she coaxes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes that lead a </p>
        <p>moonlit chorus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though happy now <br />
          life is brief &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask the dragonfly </p>
        <p>yielding its purple wings to autumn <br />
          beneath a veil of frost &amp; fire </p>
        <p>ascending with tenors or laughing <br />
          children who grasp shadows </p>
        <p>dressed in gypsy petals <br />
          explorers etched in moments of </p>
        <p>release in the hollow of violins <br />
          measuring time under stars &amp; branches </p>
        <p>though it feels like forever &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such  days <br />
          are resisted only momentarily </p>
        <p>slow raptures of now that outline her smile <br />
          drowning in its desire to be everywhere </p>
        <p>at once in its endless variations of <br />
          pre-war homes &amp; urban renewal </p>
