<p>How can we both have our way?<br />April sun and the spring seeds planted<br />in dry earth that shines at sunrise<br />bits of green showing winter is over.<br />My high C is darker<br />full of mountain wind,<br />and the desires it brings:<br />to turn away, to fold inward,<br />to hibernate in a warm cave.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you hear the low<br />  <em>come to me</em> humming from my body,<br />fear trembling the words,<br />my hair so on edge<br />it needs to be stroked down.<br />What my body wants is the slowest<br />touching, an answering hum<br /><em>I know how it is, I will spare you.</em></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t shake me awake, or startle<br />me into spring light, getting to the point<br />which is not the point at all.<br />Aren&rsquo;t my scars still visible?<br />I hate a voice with an undertow<br />of insistence, its slow calm reason.<br />Don&rsquo;t make me make sense.<br />Look, in the thawed dirt,<br />aren&rsquo;t there bits of green showing</p>
