<h1>Same Old </h1>
<p>The same old story is different with each<br />re-telling. &nbsp;What <U>did</U> mother say?&nbsp; One <br />of the sisters asserts her truth to the other's<br />
incredulity--someone has to be right. <br />
Was the forest dark or light? &nbsp;Chiaroscuro <br />
doesn't count. &nbsp;It's not logic but will, <br />
the will to win. &nbsp;The trail in Mohican Park <br />
leads to Lyons' Cave, deep and murky <br />
with its rocky brow above the spring<br />
you can drink from, or could. &nbsp;And the dark rot<br />
of leaves under the oaks sprouts morels<br />
you can fry, spongy smoke on the tongue.</p>
<p>You can't make people get along. <br />Are the sisters speaking? &nbsp;One sulks <br />outside. &nbsp;The other begins again, <br />the audience all her own. &nbsp;Branches<br />break their fall, and the few grasses<br />are shriveled. &nbsp;Why enter the forest at all?<br />The arrowheads have been harvested,<br />and all the bones filed into needles.</p>
