<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A mine, once there, cannot stop wanting to be a<br />  mine again, in someone's mind. &nbsp;Old sticks of dynamite,<br />  left behind in a tumble-down shack, cannot stop wanting<br />  to explode.&rdquo; &nbsp;&mdash;Dennis Tedlock</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A woman, once a miner, cannot stop wanting <br />to be trapped again&mdash;<br />in someone's mind&mdash;chained like a dog to the coal cart,<br />saturated, crawling on hands and feet.<br />Like old sticks of dynamite, water-logged<br />and left behind, she cannot stop wanting to explode.</p>
<p>And is a woman wanting to be a woman again, <br />in someone's mind? &nbsp;If she is in no one's mind,<br />what is she wanting?<br />While she is waiting, is she both bat and worm?<br />In her tumble-down body, what is waiting to explode?<br />Who loves her body? &nbsp;Who hollows it out?</p>
<p>As she navigates low tunnels, does a woman<br />become the mine? &nbsp;The mine's long shaft, a woman? <br />Will she faint if her mind explodes in someone else's mind?<br />If she trembles in every nerve from a day of mining,<br />who keeps her waiting?<br />As she steps into the light, what can she become?</p>
