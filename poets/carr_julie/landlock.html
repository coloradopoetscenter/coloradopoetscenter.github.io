<h1>Landlocked Lines</h1>
<p>There were  people behind closed doors People on the other side</p>
<p><em>A specter haunting now hidden now fled</em></p>
<p>Under the  firmament above the firmament and so on</p>
<p>Plastic  cup, plastic tooth, nipple, phone, call me</p>
<p>I was  filming a movie but my brother took my camera and broke it</p>
<p>Then he  fell upon his face and laughed into the snow</p>
<p>Zebra and  xylophone cyclone and sorrow</p>
<p>Before they  lay down, the men of the city circled the park</p>
<p>Circled the  park circled the park the park the park</p>
<p>Stood  before the door holding the wrapped infant and</p>
<p>I was  writing a poem in the alley, a woman came, hovered near, asked for my pen, I  gave it up</p>
<p>Consumed in  inequity, consumed: give me a child or I will die, she cried</p>
<p>Shrugs away  our hands, our mother in the bath in the garden</p>
<p>The music  is not great because she said because of the sadness she said</p>
<p>Primate and  psyche umbrage and rag</p>

<p>It would be  absurd to imagine the absent person in the margins of the book</p>
<p>Red couch,  red wall behind</p>
<p>The birds  are inside the trees now the first one and the second one</p>
<p>Giraffe and  guest and honor and hunt</p>
<p>Then she  gave up her spirit but couldn&rsquo;t get out</p>
