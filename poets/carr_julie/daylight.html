<h1>Daylight Abstracts</h1>
<p align="right">Now flare. Now come to. Now speaking  of plastics, salt, snow. </p>
<p>Bright maybe, I cannot give up on you. Cannot <em>taste</em> now or rare or last<em>.</em> Snow&rsquo;s got its own flash of rightness, own door to, say, plow, or slung, or sky  of gunmetal floating down. Said on rising, walking: can&rsquo;t love this ordinary  diurnal run? Can&rsquo;t not. </p>

<p>Always presenting: Own doors, own chairs, roads, ads. Am I in the  wrong place now? Snow&rsquo;s laced by exhaust. Don&rsquo;t own sex or house just ringed  by, walled in. Haul my rude ways to righteous? Night? I&rsquo;ve ruined its  effervescent waves. </p>

<p>Now flight, now gift, now speaking of plastics, of rupture of  corrode. Woke corridored by calendar, woke exhausted in face, spoken of and  speaking into thing cold and needing. Needling too.</p>

<p align="right">Old darkness ruptured, old bent over  defeated, </p>
<p>now rectangles of fluorescent, of bold blonde daylight </p>
<p>on walls of old dreck now spun to gestalt or defense or splayed  hair, now old odes or seeds of thought turned snug in gummy mugs: I&rsquo;m alone  here in a day like an arrow or a lance in a gash. Day, don&rsquo;t say things, don&rsquo;t  order, </p>
<p align="right">don&rsquo;t bend me, don&rsquo;t mold.</p>
