<h1>Minimus Poem</h1>
<p>I,  Minimus: a word, the curves of my mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I  need better light&frac34;to read the fatness in my  hair</p>
<p>My  foot, oh my foot, my thick soled foot:<br />we&rsquo;re  safe until we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Giant  steed of another, hooded and furiously <br />banking,  let fly a shaft from his bent bow: a violation</p>
<p>so  grieved as into me he gave his youth</p>
<p>Overshadowing  virgin woods:<br />baleful  June with her sleeping face </p>
<p>lent  me my huge destiny</p>
<p>All  reading is dead: only this, my hand,<br />moves  My eyes in their sockets,</p>
<p>like  lovers on TV, like two buses over-brimmed <br />with  goers to a beer festival, my eyes like gunmen</p>
<p>or  girls in mourning, both: Put it away! Put it away! </p>
<p>The  pebble of the possible<br />Truth  as a source! I am water&frac34;pooling </p>
<p>I,  Minimus, am hungry, perpetually, like a plant<br />am  formed of unforming is why I give nothing have nothing</p>
<p>to  give Autumn, in the end, is just a &ldquo;cold infusion&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />Maybe  so, but here there is little time left for comedy</p>
