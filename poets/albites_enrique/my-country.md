<p>my  country doesn&rsquo;t exist<br />
there  aren&rsquo;t pink dolphins there<br />
there  aren&rsquo;t men who eat cats<br />
or  pineapples so big<br />
that  could block the sun</p>
<p>my  country doesn&rsquo;t exist<br />
in  the absent figure of my father</p>
<p>my  country doesn&rsquo;t exist<br />
I  come from myself<br />
I  am its pink dolphins<br />
the  head-shrinker cannibal<br />
the  Nazca lines<br />
the  light in my eyes</p>
<p>my  country doesn&rsquo;t exist<br />
I  am my country<br />
it  starts in the North<br />
very  close to the equator line<br />
or  rather at the hirsute ends of my hair<br />
it  ends in the South in Tacna<br />
in  the border with Chile<br />
or  I should say in some nail<br />
of  my left foot</p>
<p>the  political capital of my country is not Lima<br />
but  my heart<br />
its  population is one at the most<br />
it  lacks an official religion<br />
and  doesn&rsquo;t even have a coin of its own</p>
<p>it  was born from primal clay<br />
a  product of sperm and egg<br />
that  came out of bigger countries</p>
<p>my  country is just in South America<br />
hardly  washed by the immense foam<br />
of  the pacific sea</p>
<p>one  day, my country will dieâ€¦<br />
(Translation  by Dr. Vicent Moreno, Arkansas State University)</p>
