<p>By  the river of any given city,<br />a  rider looks over the dirty photograph<br />
where  Bucephalus and I stick our tongues out at him.</p>
<p>The  buildings that were full of people are empty now, he&rsquo;d repeat,<br />while  Bucephalus reminisced over my face<br />
how  the girl that inhabited my dreams used to live in one of them.</p>
<p>By  the river of any given city,<br />we,  the speedy comrades,<br />break  up the time<br />
to  invent new horizons.</p>
<p>The  little I learned from life was to know how to fall<br />Saint  Paul St. 5 pm <br />Bucephalus  and I, all powdered up,<br />
freshen  up in the waters to get over the shock</p>
<p>I  met Bucephalus the day that mom<br />pierced  his tires with a kitchen knife<br />to  prevent me from falling in life,<br />the  noisy streets of the city&rsquo;s sector number seven,<br />
in  which the grass had already stopped growing. </p>
<p>A  few years later with the same knife<br />I  started to cut my fingertips<br />and  offered my blood in little containers<br />
hoping  to descend to the basement.</p>
<p>Bucephalus  and I have walked different paths:<br />He…  hidden in a basement&rsquo;s darkness.<br />I…  running away from cities.<br />Bucephalus  and I have walked the same path<br />because  running away from cities is <br />
nothing  but hiding in a basement&rsquo;s darkness.</p>
<p>Against  all odds, we survived.</p>
<p>Now,  Bucephalus and I walked from city to city,<br />we  face the windmills on the roads<br />singing  a song in freedom.<br />
