<p>Cliffs  and the strength of waves,<br />visions  of summer,<br />a  golden blanket over the violent Pacific,<br />children&rsquo;s  laughs,<br />stupid  tourists, a human mass<br />converging  in a reduced space.</p>
<p>The  breeze blows in the happy faces<br />of  the two lovers, far away the albatrosses<br />in  flames hurl themselves <br />into  the Pacific Ocean, she says:<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the Big Sur, it happens all the time&rdquo;, <br />The  tourists flee in terror,<br />drive  away in their vehicles, Godzilla<br />emerges  from the waters and devours an Asian man<br />and  his camera. <br />She  looks at him, calmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give you peace of mind,&rdquo; she tells him,<br />he  looks at her, lovingly, and replies:<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the Big Sur, it happens all the time&rdquo;,<br />and  hand in hand they walk away.<br />
(Translation  by Dr. Vicent Moreno, Arkansas State University)  </p>
