<p><em>We were sitting underneath a fig tree</em> <br />
Barret  Smith</p>
<p>I put my  hands together<br />
to  collect pecans from the ground<br />
I hide  them in my pockets<br />
to run  backwards through the streets.</p>
<p>I never  saw a Pecan Tree<br />
Until I  set foot in Jonesboro, AR.<br />
But when  I saw one the first time<br />
I  thought of my mother, I thought of Peru,<br />
In her  homeland Ica, the desert<br />
She left  behind the year she was born.</p>
<p>I like  to go around the Pecan Tree <br />
I like  how my kids climb it <br />
From  there they tell me stories and jokes:<br />
&ldquo;Her  name was Barb and she had to fart&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Trees  are books also<br />
Books  that devours us<br />
From  within like little cannibals <br />
Books  that hang like human flesh <br />
from the  Pecan Tree that grows inside us<br />
Books  are hanged <br />
<em>Little women</em>, <br />
<em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em> <br />
<em>Treasure Island</em>, <br />
and my  runaway and lonely heart. </p>
<p>(poem published in <em>Arkansas  Review</em> 46.3 (Fall 2015): 181. Print.)</p>
