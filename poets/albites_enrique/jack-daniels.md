<p>What  surprises me the most are not suicidal fanatics blowing up in a thousand pieces<br />
in  the streets of Baghdad or that we are losing a war that we are <br />
winning,<br />
it  doesn&rsquo;t surprise me either that Bill from Kansas, 22 years-old, my buddy in  many drunken nights, games of pool and poker, with whom I laughed and cried  remembering<br />
our  families, is now coming back home,<br />
frozen  in a bag as black as the stone adored by those fanatics in the southern  country,<br />
it&rsquo;s  not surprising that a few weeks ago we had to riddle the minivan with<br />
a  whole family inside, just because we got scared <br />
when  they got too close to our patrol,<br />
it&rsquo;s  less surprising that I had to travel this far to realize I don&rsquo;t<br />
love  you or that the modern science of our doctors could save my life but<br />
couldn&rsquo;t  save good old Bill&rsquo;s nor my legs or my arms,<br />
no  wonder either that everybody speaks a perfect English around the hospital<br />
in  the base in Germany and even children drink more beer than <br />
Bill  and I together,<br />
what  surprises me the most is that one time your face and smile would paint me like<br />
a  Polaroid torch in the living room of our rented little house in Albany, Jack  and Lucy forever,]<br />
the  perfect boyfriend, the ingenious, the comedian, the patriot who instantly  became<br />
the  charlatan, the stupid, the alcoholic,<br />
the  end of love is a bag as black as the stone adored by those fanatics in the  southern country,]<br />
when  we rebuild our lives with other Jacks, other Lucys.<br />
that&rsquo;s  what really surprises me the most…<br />
(Translation  by Dr. Vicent Moreno, Arkansas State University)</p>
