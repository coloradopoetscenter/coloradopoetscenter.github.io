          <h1>The Last of Winter in Rattlesnake Canyon</h1>
          <p>Rock doves huddle <br />
            upon balanced rock,<br />
            bubble and knock <br />
            out liquid hymns, </p>
          <p>a lullaby high above <br />
            the wicked canyon floor, <br />
            below the circled taunts <br />
            of raven cackle, </p>
          <p>forgotten by the coyote, <br />
            his rotten bones pulled <br />
            from the Pollack Bench, <br />
            he lies frozen in time</p>
          <p>with little meat <br />
            on his frame, until this,<br />
            his last winter wanes<br />
            and his paws begin to thaw. </p>
          <p>The titmouse ducks <br />
            into twisted juniper<br />
            and taps its beak <br />
            around its twisted spine, </p>
          <p>rhythms stretch <br />
            over quiet snows, <br />
            deep in the secrets <br />
            held by shadows, </p>
          <p>muddied in the most <br />
            public of solitudes, <br />
            I weep for the change <br />
            and welcome it just the same.</p>
