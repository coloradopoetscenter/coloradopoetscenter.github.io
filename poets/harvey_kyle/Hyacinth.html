 <h1>Hyacinth</h1>
<p>The soil is soiled by the blood of a child,<br />the soil is soiled<br />the soil is soiled by blood,</p>
<p>a flower blooms, reborn in the musty breaths<br />of layered gray, in the musty breaths <br />of mountain caves, in the musty breaths<br />from the west near Thrace.</p>
<p>In the comfort of angels a child has starved,<br />in the comfort of angels<br />in the comfort of angels a child,</p>
<p>the last of his soprano muffled by a rush,<br />a clash of altos in the winds of green,<br />roots held down by first and second priests,<br />in the rush of wind a child has starved.</p>
<p>The child is laid upon a bed <br />of ash and willow, dirt and leaves,<br />under a blanket, the black leather of night. </p>
<p>To mourn at the end and in the shortness of days,<br />to mourn in the weary corners of grief,<br />to mourn in darkness, hour after hour</p>
<p>in the black tar mastic,<br />cold whore moan<br />of lonely nights, <br />we mourn, we mourn, we mourn. </p>
<p>When the hot sick panic begins to boil,<br />when the hot sick panic<br />when the hot sick panic begins,<br />Â <br />nothing but emphatic Holy static<br />nothing but Holy static<br />nothing but<br />nothing but Holy<br />nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The days grow longer and the weight shifts,<br />the hell of night begins to lift,<br />spring&rsquo;s firstborn spills from blue, <br />bulbs upturned at the ends of their stems.</p>
<p>The Holy static slowly fades away,<br />the Holy static slowly<br />the Holy static slowly fades,</p>
<p>piles of cold dry bones near the mouths of caves<br />brought back to life by the will of the wind, <br />brought back to life by the will of his breath, <br />to the west in vanished layers, <br />layers and layers and layers of gray. Still</p>
<p>every year we mourn in darkness,<br />every year we mourn the blood of a child<br />starved in the comfort of angels, every year <br />we mourn for Hyacinth<br />in the tight black leather of night. </p>
