          <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          <p>&quot;Kyle Harvey&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>July</em>&nbsp;sounds the space of the page the world pivots around. It walks through every room of a redacted sky. It is &ldquo;a language (inside of a language).&rdquo; It is a ghost making grave rubbings.&nbsp;<em>July</em>&nbsp;is listening.&nbsp;<em>July</em>&nbsp;is alive.&quot; <br />
- Eric Baus, <em>The Tranquilized Tongue</em>&nbsp;(City Lights Books) </p>
          <p>&quot;Kyle Harvey's <em>July</em> is a restrained jaunt deep into its weird sluice. Reading it is like looking at a solar eclipse.&quot; </p>

          <p>Kyle Harvey&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>July&nbsp;</em>activates for its reader what the month of the July feels like in December, how warmth&rsquo;s sensation feels when it&rsquo;s dark and cold and dreary out. When Harvey writes &ldquo;July is truth is/ the color of teeth/wealth/ &amp; well/of clear water,&rdquo; his &ldquo;July&rdquo; is a stand-in for everything that humanity lies about during its perpetual search for the &ldquo;clear water&rdquo; of truth. Like so many of the poetic foremothers and fathers that he namechecks at the beginning of the collection, Harvey&rsquo;s poetry searches not for meaning but the meaning of meaning; &ldquo;Queen of Black Oil/ don&rsquo;t ask me//what I&nbsp;<em>mean</em>/Â  /<em>meaning</em>/ is the murder of process.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>July&nbsp;</em>isn&rsquo;t a chapbook full of poems about the month of the July. It&rsquo;s a chapbook full of poems about what the month of July felt like before there was a language to describe it, before July&rsquo;s sweaty presence found July&rsquo;s sweaty word. Harvey&rsquo;s words are honeyed against the elements and, like it or not, linger in your mouth long afterwards. &nbsp; <br />
            - Jeff Alessandrelli, This Last Time Will Be The First, Burnside Review </p>
          <p>&quot;Essentially empty of narrative elements, <em>July</em> lets the objects speak for the interior life of the speaker. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me / what I <em>mean</em> / <em>meaning</em> / is the murder of process,&rdquo; serves as a mission statement for <em>July</em>.&nbsp;Kyle Harvey can certainly feel a feeling and reflect those feelings.&quot; <br />
