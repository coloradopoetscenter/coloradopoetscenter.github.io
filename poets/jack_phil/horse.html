  <h1>Finding Comfort on the Back of a Horse</h1>  <p>There are times<br /> When the vast emptiness<br /> Of the prairie<br /> Reflects a hollowness<br /> I feel inside.<br /> When the sound<br /> Of the wind<br /> Echoes in the vacant<br /> Chambers of my heart.</p>  <p>There have been times<br /> When I have sought<br /> Solitude,<br /> Longing for the gentle peace<br /> Of the quiet land,<br /> But sometimes<br />  The silence overpowers me.</p>  <p>I seek comfort<br /> In the saddle,<br /> Feeling the harmony<br /> That can only be found<br /> On the back of a horse,<br /> My spirit matching<br /> The rhythm,<br /> Of the hushed beat<br /> Of her hooves<br /> As Rose dances<br />  Across the prairie.</p>  <p>Her spirit<br /> Speaks to mine,<br /> Setting me free<br /> From the shackles<br /> Of loneliness<br /> And self-doubt.</p>  <p>On the back<br /> Of a horse,<br /> My wounded spirit<br /> Finds shelter<br /> From my inner tempests.</p>  <p>(Published in MAZ: Muse Arts Zine,( May 2013)</p>
