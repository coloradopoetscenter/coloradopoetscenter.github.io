  <h1>Storm on the Horizon</h1>  <p>Lightening dances across the horizon<br />  Racing from dark clouds blanketing rocky peaks</p>  <p>To snow-capped Sandia.<br /> Overhead, stars sparkle just beyond our reach<br /> Beckoning for attention.<br /> Below, city lights crowd the mesa on which we stand,<br /> Making Albuquerque seem so alive we could watch it grow.<br /> On the mesa,<br /> We sit,<br /> Breathing in life,<br /> Feeling it tickle our souls.<br /> Cary picks at guitar strings<br /> And sings a song he wrote.<br /> His music tells of a love lived, love lost,<br /> And the pain felt deep inside.<br /> He sees the storm clouds,<br /> Still feels the rain.<br /> The storm has passed,<br /> And another might follow,<br /> But--right now--<br /> I see the stars,<br /> And I can't keep from reaching for them.<br /> Soon, the early morning sun<br /> Pushes the clouds away.<br /> There's life in the sunshine,<br /> There's also life in the rain.<br /> And, sometimes it's easy to see love,<br /> But, there's also love in the pain,<br /> Denying love means living empty.<br /> I can't turn away from the stars<br /> Just because I've felt the rain.</p>  <p>(Published in The 4th Annual Writer's Digest&quot; Poetry Awards, 2009).</p>
