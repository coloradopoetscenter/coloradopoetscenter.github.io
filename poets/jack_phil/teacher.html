  <h1>Teacher's Lament</h1>  <p>&quot;If you really loved teaching,&quot; the senator said,<br /> &quot;You'd do it for free.&quot;<br />  I replied, &quot;And if you valued education,</p>  <p>You'd be willing to pay me.&quot;<br /> Our actions show our values.<br /> We spend more<br /> On what's important to us,<br /> Whether we spend<br /> Time or money.<br /> Teachers are paid<br /> For the time we spend in class,<br /> Not for the hours<br /> We spend preparing,<br /> Grading papers,<br /> Counseling,<br /> Comforting,<br /> Encouraging,<br /> Learning,<br /> Trying to inspire.<br /> That time is spent<br /> Because we love teaching.<br /> &quot;You'd do it for free&quot;<br /> Shows how much<br /> Value is placed on education.<br /> To him, the work we do<br /> Is worth nothing.</p>
