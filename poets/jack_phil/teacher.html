          <h1>Teacher's Lament</h1>
          <p>&quot;If you really loved teaching,&quot; the senator said,<br />
            &quot;You'd do it for free.&quot;<br />
          I replied, &quot;And if you valued education,</p>
          <p>You'd be willing to pay me.&quot;<br />
            Our actions show our values.<br />
            We spend more<br />
            On what's important to us,<br />
            Whether we spend<br />
            Time or money.<br />
            Teachers are paid<br />
            For the time we spend in class,<br />
            Not for the hours<br />
            We spend preparing,<br />
            Grading papers,<br />
            Counseling,<br />
            Comforting,<br />
            Encouraging,<br />
            Learning,<br />
            Trying to inspire.<br />
            That time is spent<br />
            Because we love teaching.<br />
            &quot;You'd do it for free&quot;<br />
            Shows how much<br />
            Value is placed on education.<br />
            To him, the work we do<br />
            Is worth nothing.</p>
