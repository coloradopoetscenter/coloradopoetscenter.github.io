<h1>Eating Fry-Bread with Paula Gunn Allan</h1>
<p>Her poems are tall, strong, sometimes fierce,<br />So I was surprised to see her<br />Small, round figure and the smile<br />  That teetered on the brink of laughter.</p>
<p>We sat outside the Blue-Eyed Indian Bookstore,<br />Run by Leslie's mom,<br />Displaying Leslie's dad's photographs,<br />And we talked about Leslie</p>
<p>As we ate Indian Fry-Bread<br />
And watched the sun set.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good,&quot; Ken exclaims.<br />Paula winks at me and shakes her head.<br />Leave it to the educated white man<br />To feel a need to put words to the experience<br />Of having oven-hot fry-bread, melted butter,<br />Sweet berry jam swirl in the mouth until it becomes<br />Part of us, tasting history (the bread baked in earthen<br />ovens<br />More than a thousand years old,<br />Fried in black White Man pans,<br />Jam made by berries picked and mixed by hands<br />taught<br />By her mother,<br />Who was taught by her mother,<br />Who was taught . . .).</p>
<p>And Ken calls it &quot;good.&quot;<br />Paula and I look at the sun,<br />Watch as it spreads its crimson and orange fire<br />Across the horizon,<br />Mixing colors with the deep earth red of the desert<br />And the dark grey stone of the mesa.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Paula says. &quot;It's good.&quot;<br />For a moment, I understand the poet.</p>
