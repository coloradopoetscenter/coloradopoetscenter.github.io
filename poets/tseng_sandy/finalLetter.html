  <h1>Final Letter </h1>  <p>With it comes the salt  that clings to everything:<br /> our mouths thirsty for  hours afterward.  It’s in the food we  eat.<br /> The meat that wants to  return to the bone clumps in the pan, <br />  and we sprinkle salt over  it to signify finality.  </p>  <p>The salt falls over us  and we try to clean it off: the faint<br /> dusting over the coat,  the gloves, the laces of our boots.  <br /> We stomp our feet, leave  the shoes at the door, but there are traces of it <br /> streaked across the  hardwood floor.  From the dog’s  paws.  <br /> From the cuffs of our  pants.  </p>  <p>It takes a while.  Some days the body is so numb, it does not  know<br /> whether it is on the bone  or off the bone.  We press ice to an  injury<br /> to detach it from the  body.  To stop the pain, the  accident.  <br /> Although someone is icing  the injuries of the city, there is no <br /> numbing it.  We sprinkle a little salt on the steps.  The ice melts in seconds <br /> and takes days to freeze  again.  </p>  <p>“Final Letter” from  SEDIMENT (c) 2009 by Sandy Tseng.
