          <h1>City View          
          </h1>
          <p>In the window where the  city is contained,<br />
            where rain collects along  the edges<br />
            like words moving over  the tongue,<br />
            the space between two  people narrow and widen<br />
            and narrow again.  A man arrives against <br />
            the odds.  A woman reads a map of the city.  <br />
            Since they have never  met, they are not aware<br />
            of the decades between  them.  It’s true that she studied years <br />
            of Spanish and has none  of it to recall.  One day she points<br />
            to the cover of a book  and the wrong words come out.  <br />
            It’s happened  before.  Over centuries we meticulously<br />
            name the planets.  Now as if an afterthought<br />
            someone points to the sky  and declares a planet <br />
            no longer a planet.  We start over.  The woman <br />
            with the map, the marker;  the man with his sketches<br />
            and designs.  In the windowpane, the strangers are blurred<br />
            as the rain falls against  it.</p>
