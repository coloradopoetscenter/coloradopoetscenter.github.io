          <h1>Afterwards          </h1>
          <p>The  rain fell on another city.  <br />
            I  scooped handfuls of leaves into the car<br />
            as  a way of holding on.  Some things <br />
            we  were never meant to keep.  <br />
            I was calling on the name <br />
            of winter by the  Monongahela<br />
            where the water was  bitter.  <br />
            I have seen dead fish in  the river <br />
            with eyes open like the  hungry.  <br />
            When I was a child, a man  so poor <br />
            and starved haunted my  dreams.<br />
            He would sit in the  market crowds<br />
            with a tin cup between  his wasted hands.<br />
            At night he wandered into  my twin bed<br />
            where I held his body in  my sleep.  <br />
            There was something  familiar about him<br />
            as if years later he  would remind me <br />
            of someone else I clung  to <br />
            while his body dwindled  in my arms.<br />
            There’s a kind of  desperation <br />
            we never know until the  flesh wastes away<br />
            down to the bone.  In some ways <br />
            I never knew my father  until then.<br />
            At night I’d wander to  his bed to hold <br />
            his swollen hands.  For years <br />
            we lived together and  could not <br />
            speak them—the words <br />
            in his whispered  breathing <br />
            falling like strands of  hair.           </p>
