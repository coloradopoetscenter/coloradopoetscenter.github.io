  <h1>August </h1>  <p>In the  city where no one wants to settle,<br /> we stay  through the winter.  It’s summer again <br />  and  another autumn coming.  The flies die </p>  <p>and come  to life, like many of us here.<br /> Someone  has been picking the tomatoes out <br /> of the  garden before their time.  Day by day</p>  <p>we wonder  if our time has come.  We get ready<br /> to  leave.  We gather the fragments of the  ground <br /> and  decide on what we can make of them.  </p>  <p>Earth and  porcelain with terra sigillata, <br /> sand,  glass, straw, flecks of yellow and cinder.  <br /> What we  don’t know is that months from now, </p>  <p>something  will call us back to the city just as <br /> we are  leaving.  We become objects picked up<br /> by the  wind, circling over the fields, over the lake</p>  <p>cold with  rainfall—earth and porcelain, sand, <br /> glass,  straw.  The leaves fall over us again,<br /> circling  the city as if there is nowhere else to go. </p>  <p>“August” from  SEDIMENT (c) 2009 by Sandy Tseng.
