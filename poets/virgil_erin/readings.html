<h1>Readings / Workshop Availability</h1>  <p>Since I&rsquo;m a part time freelancer right now, looking for work in  schools, colleges, anywhere, I am very happy and available to volunteer in  schools with Colorado Poets, giving readings or teaching poetry, pretty much  any time.  I taught literacy to special  needs kids for over a year, and hope to return to that field, if I can figure  out how to get certified in Colorado.</p>  <p>My phone # is 720 612 8702, best email address is  <a href="mailto:latecrow@yahoo.com">latecrow@yahoo.com</a>, </p>
