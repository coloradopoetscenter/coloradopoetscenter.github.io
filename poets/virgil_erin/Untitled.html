  <h1>[Untitled] </h1>  <p>(for Maria Alyokhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, and Yekaterina  Samutsevich )</p>  <p>Far away women:<br /> lines lead up to your lives<br /> from the North and East,<br /> places we find unfamiliar. <br /> But your faces speak clearly behind the glass<br /> where you sit poised, like queens.
