 </div>  <h1>Clear Creek RV Park</h1>  <p>We rolled in and were instantly <br /> crowned the junkyard dogs, no, &quot;most resourceful.&quot;<br /> Old folks admire our relative youth <br /> neighborhood kids stop by and swap books, gossip.<br /> And all night long our 1988 Ford Jamboree<br /> wears white Christmas lights, a crown.</p>  <p>Deep, colorless Clear Creek is one path nearby <br /> the Milky Way is another.<br /> At night you hear <br /> the rushes. The rushes. </p>  <p>Then, from some far corner, Chinooks come down, <br /> pass over the tin roof<br /> like ghost hands tapping messages.<br /> We are broke <br /> but we are also old light.<br /> Winter constellations are fellow travelers.</p>  <p>Earth was dug up<br /> into a town called Golden. <br /> Always a vague fear of the earth caving in?<br /> Blame the School of Mines.<br /> But then, their M  on the mountain is a kind of lighthouse,<br /> see it from the highway, you're almost home.</p>  <p>(Originally published in Â <em>Colorado  Life Magazine</em><em>,</em> Jan. 2013.</p>
