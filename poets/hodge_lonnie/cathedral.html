              <h1>Cathedral</h1>
              <p>                Below open spires of red rock<br />
                the deer rinses dead skin<br />
                from his shriveled antlers,<br />
                then hobbles away, browsing, <br />
                through buckskin grass, <br />
                color gone worthless in the fall sun.<br />
                He has turned broadside to me,<br />
                but he is safe. I have no weapons <br />
                but memory. Our last hunt here,<br />
                my father had to stop <br />
                every few feet to beg for air.<br />
                I went on to pray for the miracle<br />
                that would flush from the low cedars,<br />
                and run straight for my father, <br />
                who pulled the trigger <br />
                without taking aim.<br />
                It is a miraculous love<br />
                that commends a toothless man,<br />
                kneeling before a bloody animal,<br />
                laughing, gasping, laughing.<br />
                <br />
                for Joe Hodge<br />
                1921-1988<br />
