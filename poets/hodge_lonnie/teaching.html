              <h1>Teaching</h1>
              <p> I want to be <br />
                witches knees and elbows:<br />
                roots just barely visible <br />
                enough above ground<br />
                to stumble into a child's<br />
                imagination forever.<br />
                I want to be<br />
                the breeze in the aspens, <br />
                barely loud enough <br />
                to waken the leaves <br />
                but not quiet the birds.<br />
                I want to be <br />
                the loneliness<br />
                in the center<br />
                of a Japanese pine seed, <br />
                dropped from some kid's pocket<br />
                in the Colorado Sand Dunes,<br />
                and have everyone wondering<br />
          how it is I came to be there.</p>
