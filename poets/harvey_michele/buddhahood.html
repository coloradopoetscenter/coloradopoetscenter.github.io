              <h1>Buddhahood<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
              <p>The Japanese have recovered well despite<br />
                radiation, rice for breakfast, green tea<br />
          on trays in place of coveted coffee.</p>
              <p>Go there and  you&rsquo;ll lose your shoes<br />
                in front of every doorway,<br />
                be soothed by steaming washcloths, shoji  screens,<br />
          sweet red bean, and sandalwood beads.</p>
              <p>In the home of  my eternal life<br />
                there was no sign of Jesus from the floor<br />
                packed with strangers where I remained<br />
                on my knees, praying to Buddha, till my  feet<br />
          were the color of cherry blossoms.</p>
