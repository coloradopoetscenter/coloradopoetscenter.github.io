title: Michele Harvey : Beneath the Water

<h1>Beneath the Water</h1>
<p>It was April in  August<br />and the ship rocked on choppy waves.<br />They say everything you learn becomes a  tool,<br />  that an old spring brings a fresh fall.</p>
<p>After our week at sea, the ship has docked<br />in the final port and the orchestra has  paused.<br />  Sorrow needs no added strings.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m going fishing.<br />My upper and lower case<br />  infuses sound in your visual space.</p>
<p>Tell me, &ldquo;Did  our limbs in double helix<br />seem like spiral shells to you, or phantom  flesh?&rdquo;<br />Tell me, tell me again,<br />  what this wasn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>(<em>The Litchfield Review</em>)</p>
