              <h1>I Am Not In My Mother&rsquo;s Kitchen</h1>
              <p>Aunt Beth climbs the stairs to the third  floor.<br />
                At the end of a  dark hall she fumbles<br />
          with the deadbolt.</p>
              <p>She walks through  a narrow foyer<br />
                takes a sharp right, and enters the kitchen<br />
          belonging to my mother.</p>
              <p>The kitchen has homely green curtains,<br />
                An old wood pantry, and a freezer which  like mother<br />
          needs defrosting.</p>
              <p>The railroad  rumbles a glass of old scotch<br />
                on the wooden counter, and water&rsquo;s boiling<br />
          on the old gas stove.</p>
              <p>Beth has shown  up to shop for lamps<br />
                with mother, but discovers her slumped<br />
          on the white vinyl floor.</p>
              <p>There&rsquo;s no sign of forced entry, though few  came<br />
                to see mother willingly.&nbsp; And now Beth is afraid<br />
          to touch her.&nbsp; Even alive, my mother was untouchable.</p>
              <p>Beth turns off the stove, calls the police.<br />
                She reaches for the scotch, curses God for  being left<br />
          to deal with this mess.</p>
              <p>There will be no new lamp to liven this  empty space.<br />
                There is no blood.<br />
          There is no sorrow.</p>
              <p>Beth curses the police,<br />
                who like mother, failed to arrive,<br />
          when needed.</p>
