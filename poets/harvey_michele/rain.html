          <h1>The Meaning of Rain</h1>
          <p>There&rsquo;s a diamond in your life,<br/>
            Unsinkable, infallible, and ever-bright.<br/>
            Your soul forever grows its light.<br/>
            We are rainbows in life's prism.<br/>
            Your soul&rsquo;s a deep-sea diver.<br/>
            It swims with every kind of fish.<br/>
            It reaches with each breath beyond horizons.<br/>
            When you're thirsty, rain may come to call.<br/>
            I sometimes need to fall so I remember.<br/>
            I make my own heaven.</p>
