<h1>Captured Aspen Leaves</h1>
<p>Tart lemon  leaves on aspen trees<br />toss on the breeze for a season.<br />  Aspens speak in quiet splashes.</p>
<p>Blowing below blue autumn hues,<br />adorning arm-like branches<br />  colored sails swirl round in layers.</p>
<p>When wind forces, leaves disrobe trees,<br />refueling ground so branches rebound,<br />  left bare wearing winter&rsquo;s makeup.</p>
