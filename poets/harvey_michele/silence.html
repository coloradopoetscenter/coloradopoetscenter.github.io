title: Michele Harvey : Listen to the Silence


---

  <h1>Listen to the Silence</h1>  <p>You are the color of the wind that sails beyond<br/> your every breath – listen to the silence.<br/> You are the solo in the stillness of a tree weeping in low frets.<br/> There is no reader whose eyes you have not met, no speech you&rsquo;ve never said.<br/> Each light or dreaded deed is also you, who crosses any sea,<br/> or fails to turn a cheek.<br/> Did you surrender nothing and still remain alone? It was not random fortune.<br/> You are the color of the wind that sails beyond<br/> your every breath -  a timeless life through which God&rsquo;s work unfolds.<br/> Beyond definition – as free from confinement – as perfumed earth –<br/> you are the silk and the spice that fills the world. </p>  <p> Copyright © 2011 &amp; beyond by Michele Harvey - All rights reserved</p>
