              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>On Dinosaur  Ridge Dakota Hogback<br />
                Sandstone is  home to stegosaurus bones<br />
                Morrison formation stops in its tracks<br />
          Preserved allosaurus bones settle in stone</p>
              <p>Fish scales etch in gray shale from a lost  sea<br />
                A sea whose  ripples rest on the freeway<br />
                Over tracks of their past birds wander free<br />
          These foothills share stories of yesterday</p>
              <p>Asteroid  collision dusts blocked sun<br />
                Plants starved in the darkness of space  debris<br />
                Just dinosaur  trails left in Morrison<br />
          Framed by fields of flowers windblown and  free</p>
              <p>Brontosaurus  dinosaur megatracksite<br />
                Dinosaur Ridge holds history rock tight</p>
