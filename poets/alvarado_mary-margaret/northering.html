          <p>I am going <br />
            upstairs <br />
            by the ship ladder. <br />
            I will assemble <br />
            a bowl <br />
            of pears. <br />
            From a standing <br />
            dead forest. <br />
            From pecan <br />
            shells. Small views <br />
            of what’s doing <br />
            in snow. <br />
            The planks <br />
            are milled. And me. <br />
            Hey season’s folly. <br />
            Hey folly. Hey.</p>
