  <h1>It Startles</h1>  <p>Who can punctuate it? Wife.<br /> The unplantable blacktops in the past<br /> of my wife. The hurricaned<br /> petals. The combustible joints<br /> of wife. My wife getting naked<br /> under stars in a car. <br /> The chiseled and serif <br /> typeface of wife. The radiance:<br /> her fancies and goodnights.<br /> Natural law’s deduced from such <br /> movements. In the house whose root<br /> is my life. Dusky, <br /> sometimes a lioness <br /> sleeping. Taking dictation <br /> for briefs. Courting in malls<br /> gone to seed. What astonishes.<br /> Who? Cur’rants, coop’ers, wife.<br /> For’bear’ance, forbearance, life. <br /> We refused the agents <br /> of mansionization, my wife. <br /> We put the palm chakras<br /> over the eyes, which eat light.<br /> Yet we never rolled a rug<br /> and played a gramophone.<br /> And we never bit the sugar <br /> knuckle to the sugar bone.<br /> Wife, you say you saw <br /> the hook and carcass <br /> swing in the door. <br /> Tell how we took a bus to the beach<br /> to watch the cook fires go. The waves <br /> were mushy, the dark <br /> fettered down. Are pictographs <br /> better? Is archness the answer?<br /> Bonny. Ennui. To do it<br /> without the assistance of machines.<br /> Among pleas. For a time, wife and I, <br /> we were festively clothed. The flung, <br /> stony planets made wishes on us. <br /> Blinking wife, thinking wife, my piebald <br /> stitched, my soldered life. <br /> Now! The cold! Is! Past!</p>  <p>(This poem was first published in the <em>National Poetry Review)</em></p>
