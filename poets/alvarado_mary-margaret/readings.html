          <p>“[During a Friday night poetry  workshop, Mia] was dynamic, keen minded, bright,  insightful, good humored, refreshing, and so very generous with her help. I  counted more than twenty references Mia made to poets whose work she  recommended to us, along with names of specific poems and books of poetry we  might find of use. The room was abuzz with gratitude. Bucky added that Mia was  ‘masterful at balancing (and having at hand, ready to cite and share) superb  academic training with the most personable and engaging conversational style of  workshopping as Mia called it.’”—from the March 2011 minutes of the Greater  Cincinnati Writers’ League </p>
          <p>Mia has taught variously,  including at: the YWCA shelter in South Bend; St. Michael’s Academy in Manhattan;  the University of Iowa, and Osher Lifelong Learning Institute in Iowa City; the  University of Colorado and Poetry West in Colorado Springs; the Seven Hills  School and the Greater Cincinnati Writers League in Cincinnati; and the  Lighthouse  Writers’ Workshop in Denver.</p>
