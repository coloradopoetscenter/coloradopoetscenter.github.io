              <h1>The mind, Doing its number</h1>
              <p>I read the beautiful poem, felt it entering,<br />
                filling me, the way a drink of water spills<br />
through the sluice of each cell, and I didn&rsquo;t<br />
want to read any more poems. I wanted only<br />
this one. There was this loveliness now<br />
in the world, put there deliberately by someone<br />
filled with longing. I would have kissed the one<br />
who wrote it, I was ready to kiss just about<br />
anybody, so filled was I with <em>agape</em><br />
and arousal. Then mind rushed in: I tried<br />
to refuse, but I was as we are in orgasm,<br />
when we can&rsquo;t imagine even the possibility<br />
of sin. I couldn&rsquo;t shut myself fast enough<br />
to keep out the dead child, face beaten in.</p>
