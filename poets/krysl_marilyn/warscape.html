          <h1>Warscape, with Lovers
              </h1>
              <p>Scent of plumeria, and the smell of burning.<br />
                Not one or the other, but both. Destruction, and the blossom.<br />
  Sweetheart, I'm afraid. That boy with the rifle breaks<br />
  the catechism in two. And in two. Let me<br />
  see us whole, beside the sea. My body<br />
  busy, paying attention to yours. Already</p>
              <p>we rock each other with our voices. Already<br />
                we're braiding the invisible cord. That burning<br />
  hut on T.V. could be ours. My body<br />
  hers, child at dead breast. That blossom<br />
  of blood and bone could be your face. Let me<br />
  say truth: no place, no one, is safe. Breaking</p>
              <p>of vows, we know, is a given. Sweetheart, you'll break<br />
                my heart. I've broken yours, but look: already<br />
  you love me again. Destruction and the blossom: let me<br />
  say it another way: that soldier, burning<br />
  to become fabulous, torches the thatch (see blossomy<br />
  flame) of the enemy's hospital: cut to my body,</p>
              <p>clay taking shape in your hands. Body by body,<br />
                war piled on war: when will the heart break<br />
  all the way open? Thunder of mortar, blossom<br />
  in the gutter. The soldier firing the mortar already<br />
  dead. How we live: running from the burning<br />
  field, into each other's arms. Let me</p>
              <p>lie along your side. Give me something to hold. Let me<br />
                ride those waves pouring from your fingers. The bodies<br />
  of the disappeared toll like bells. Our koan burns:<br />
  it cannot be solved. The whole and the broken,<br />
  dream and nightmare: your hand in my hair, already<br />
  familiar, could be the torturer's. Vase and its blossoms</p>
              <p>camouflage for the bomb. You love where you can. Blossom: <br />
                a thing of promise. That's us. Now: let me <br />
  let this go. Our glass, half full--already<br />
  there's more--swells toward the rim. Ours the bodies<br />
  the death squads passed by. The refugees make a break<br />
  for the fence, running for their lives, crossing this burning,</p>
              <p>broken, blossoming Century. They've already<br />
                paid our dues. Sweetheart, let me show you how. <br />
  Hand on the body's book: swear the burning vow.</p>
