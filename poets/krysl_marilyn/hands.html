  <h1>Poem for the Left and Right Hands
</h1>
<p>The left hand trails in the water<br />The right is tying knots</p>
<p>The right stitches a seam<br />  The left sleeps in the silk</p>
<p>The right eats<br />  The left listens under the table</p>
<p>The right swears<br />  The left wears the rings</p>
<p>The right wing, the right loses<br />  The left holds the cards</p>
<p>The left strikes chords while the right <br />  runs, runs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up and down, up and down</p>
<p>and when the right can't sleep and travels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around the world against the clock<br />the left is buried</p>
<p>Oh left hand, you're so quiet<br />  Do you have children, a dog, mistresses, debts</p>
<p>It's the right that buys the groceries<br />shifts gears<br />runs for high office<br />feeds the baby little silver spoonfuls<br />It's the right that grabs the knife<br />to hack off the left hand</p>
<p>The left hand waits<br />  a blind dog</p>
<p>holding in its mouth<br />  the right's glove</p>
<p>The knife falls, clatters<br />  The left hand</p>
<p>is the right's only chance</p>
