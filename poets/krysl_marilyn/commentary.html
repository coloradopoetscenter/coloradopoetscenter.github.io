              <h1>Critical Commentary
              </h1>
              <p><em>Krysl is funny,  fierce, and feminist in the best possible way, and a technician of variety and  resourcefulness</em>. –John Updike</p>
              <p><em>Her great,  rambunctious sestinas anticipate &lsquo;New Formalism&rsquo;, but in their modulated  wildness and disciplined strangeness, they are better than any of it.</em> —Jonathan Holden</p>
              <p><em>She has a poet&rsquo;s  compression, a novelist&rsquo;s feel for the whole, and she is bitterly funny. </em>Rosellen  Brown</p>
              <p><em>Krysl&rsquo;s poetry is  funny, funky, tragic, brave, lyrical, humane, political and full of  surprises….She is still writing the liveliest sestinas in America.</em> –Alicia  Ostriker</p>
              <p>The more political Krysl gets, the bleaker the results—think  William Burroughs without the Misogyny. Her piece &ldquo;Welcome to the Torture  Center, Love,&rdquo; concerning a night journey through the inferno that is war-torn  Sudan, is a dazzler. –Kirkus Revi </p>
