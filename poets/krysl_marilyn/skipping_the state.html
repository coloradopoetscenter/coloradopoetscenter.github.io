  <h1>Skipping the State</h1>
<blockquote><blockquote>  <blockquote> <p><em>This crazy girl, so thoroughly fucked over</em>...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catullus</p>  </blockquote></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Know I did not speak ill of you <br />when you left me weeping and pregnant <br />in the suburbs, for that girl with spiked hair <br />and a tongue ring. I have not defaulted<br />on the mortgage, nor revealed to your enemies <br />your smoldering secret--how you liked it <br />when I pretended to have betrayed you with Robert<br />and you turned on the spit of minor league jealousy, <br />the kind with no penalty, since you knew I was<br />faking. Nor in regard to naughtier longings <br />did I turn loquacious, nor list for other women </p>
<p>your shortfalls. Grant me then the child support <br />payments, which, after all, result from your indulgence <br />and my gullibility, trusting that things you said <br />in privacy might be taken literally. Forgetting, <br />under the spell of your rhetoric, that declarations <br />men make while inside women <br />will be retroactively rescinded </p>
<p>on withdrawal. Though you, of all people, had the temerity <br />to question my fidelity, believe me the child <br />is ours. In honor then of our son&rsquo;s innocence, <br />rise, please, to this fiduciary occasion.</p>
