        <h1>Flash Backs II</h1>
        <p>Crawling  through the dense underbrush <br />
          sound  is muffled yet amplified <br />
          by our  terror.  Behind me a soft metallic ping <br />
          followed  by an echoing thump<br />
          sounding  like a small tree limb dropping<br />
          .</p>
        <p>I turn  my head slightly, get spattered<br />
          by  blood surging from his decapitated<br />
          body.  My friend, patrol mate without<br />
          his  head!  He&rsquo;s trying to push up in the  road.<br />
          Hands  positioned, left leg splayed trying</p>
        <p>to  stabilize in the bloody dirt.  His head<br />
          is  missing.  Right leg flexes then kicks<br />
          back,  once twice trying to gain traction.<br />
          Dead  yet moving.  Me immobilized alive.<br />
          Slowly  his body starts listing </p>
        <p>left  until it rests on his shoulder.<br />
          Gurgling  sounds from his bloody neck<br />
          seems  deafening, seems to fill<br />
          the  entire canopy.  In reality only<br />
          small  pops and swooshes like</p>
        <p>a  deflating balloon come from<br />
          his  body.  A new effort to raise<br />
          himself  then a final tremor.<br />
          In  twenty seconds, forty at most,<br />
          a dance  of death.  His head is gone.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m  screaming yet no sound emerges.<br />
          Bang  the road with fists of rage.<br />
          Tears  erupt yet no sound emerges.<br />
          I do  hear fast footfalls slapping<br />
          their  way through the underbrush. </p>
        <p>Then  all is silent except my screaming<br />
          body  trying to voice fear, anguish, loss,<br />
          uncertainty.  What&rsquo;s burned into my<br />
          psyche  is no longer his face, but that<br />
          headless  body trying to stand.</p>
        <p>It  doesn&rsquo;t leave me.  In movie houses,<br />
          in dark  apartment buildings, but also<br />
          in  glass strewn lots where I played<br />
          baseball  as a kid, on Central Park<br />
          walks  the scene drenches me in sweat</p>
        <p>then  wrings me out so I&rsquo;m cursing<br />
          at  joggers, looking for rocks to toss<br />
          like  hand grenades at strangers.<br />
          Where&rsquo;s  my piece?  It&rsquo;s sitting back<br />
          there,  on the bloody &lsquo;Nam road.</p>
        <p>Night&rsquo;s  are the worst.  Dreaming,<br />
          me  enclosed in a canister filling with my tears.<br />
          Awaking,  I wonder aloud, who can I tell this too?<br />
          No one,  who hasn&rsquo;t been there. </p>
        <p> the  canopy</p>
