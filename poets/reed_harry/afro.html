        <h1>Afro Headed Boy</h1>
        <p>Hair  thicker than<br />
          spiking  grass burrs <br />
        an afro  to remember.</p>
        <p>Squirrels  tried to<br />
          tiptoe  through <br />
          became  trapped by</p>
        <p>whip,  whorl, workings,<br />
          of  blood &amp; netting<br />
          electrifying  his hair and brain.</p>
        <p>Could  deep gypsy song <br />
          lure  dragonflies to navigate<br />
          wiry  spider&rsquo;s web</p>
        <p>of  locks that never<br />
          tasted  Afro Sheen?<br />
          Tangled  like forest undergrowth</p>
        <p>barbed  wire labyrinth<br />
          begging  for exit passage<br />
          and  sturdy comb.</p>
        <p>Attractive  in its own<br />
          way,  women razored<br />
          fingers  trying to smooth.<br />
          Mothers  admired the mess.<br />
          Sisters  offered combs, picks.<br />
          Buddies  envied, rhapsodized. </p>
        <p>Ancient  Greeks would<br />
          oil  and groom those locks<br />
          before  battle.</p>
        <p>Designate  him as champion, <br />
          direct  him to no-man&rsquo;s land<br />
          to  defend the polis.</p>
        <p>Horn  blast signals combat.<br />
          Without  helmet<br />
          Afro  headed boy</p>
        <p>raises  prayer to wooly crown,<br />
          enters armed  combat, confident, <br />
          humming  Motown in heroic couplets. </p>
