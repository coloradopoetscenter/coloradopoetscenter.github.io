<h1>Biography</h1><p><strong>7/2/34,</strong> my birth date and since  June 12, 2014 my mantra.  I was  hospitalized on that date and every visit of a nurse taking my vitals, every  appointment,  every call for  prescriptions had to include the 7/2/34 info.Atlantic City, NJ, my birthplace, was a great place to grow up.  Unlike today there were no ugly Trump casinos  and blocks of parking lots serving the casinos that had once been residential  and small hotel neighborhoods.<br />  I  left school at age 15, entered the US Navy at 17, and entered Los Angeles City  College at 21.  Years later I earned the  PhD in History at Michigan State University.<br />  I  was lucky enough to spend my academic career at MSU, retiring in 2000.  In that year I began a creative writing phase  that continues.  That year I published a  short story/memoir &ldquo;Me and Jackie Robinson, My Awakenings as a Historian.&rdquo; <u>Fourth</u><br /><u>Genre</u>.  Before that publication I began reading  poetry in and around central Michigan.</p>
