<h1>Stand Off</h1><p>Drifting  mosquitos alerted by our<br />  Scent,  carried on evening breeze<br />  scramble  like jets on a carrier deck<br />  falling  into several squads<br />  Prepped  for battle<br />  Squad  1, bunched but spaced for pin point patterning.<br />  Squad  2, free lancing for skip bombing fast <br />  moving targets  and end game mop up.<br />We, also alerted by  mosquitos <br />gathering  menace <br />  beat a  hasty retreat.  Behind screened fortress<br />we  listen as mosquitos vent their spleen,<br />hurl promises about  tomorrow.  </p>
