        <h1>Stand Off</h1>
        <p>Drifting  mosquitos alerted by our<br />
          Scent,  carried on evening breeze<br />
          scramble  like jets on a carrier deck<br />
          falling  into several squads<br />
          Prepped  for battle<br />
          Squad  1, bunched but spaced for pin point patterning.<br />
          Squad  2, free lancing for skip bombing fast <br />
          moving targets  and end game mop up.<br />
                             We, also alerted by  mosquitos <br />
                             gathering  menace <br />
          beat a  hasty retreat.  Behind screened fortress<br />
        we  listen as mosquitos vent their spleen,<br />
        hurl promises about  tomorrow.           </p>
