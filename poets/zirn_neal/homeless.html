<h1>Homeless on Ste-Catherine Street </h1>  <p>Homeless on Ste-Catherine Street.<br />
It&rsquo;s early evening. Men wrapped in sleeping<br />
bags, urban caterpillars, still on the sidewalk<br />
around the corner from Cinemania, <em>festival</em><br />
<em>de films francophone</em>. The best of francophone<br />
cinema.</p>  <p>The Imperial Cinema, home to Cinemania,<br /> has been renovated and restored to what would<br /> now be its ancient glory. The washrooms,<br /> (bathrooms in the U.S.) are , however, modern,<br /> with <em>tres</em> artistic faucets, muted lighting,<br /> and a genteel ambiance. Peeing in such<br /> surroundings is <em>magnifique.</em></p>  <p>I&rsquo;m here with my girlfriend, a.k.a.,<br /> significant other, partner, or <em>whomIdonotknowwhattocall,</em><br /> watching Gerard Depardieu in <em>Quand J&rsquo;etais Chanteur</em>,<br /> (&ldquo;The Singer&rdquo;). Gerard plays a small town crooner<br /> who falls in love with a younger woman.<br /> The venues are discotheques and senior citizen homes;<br /> a metaphor for the life that most of us are destined to  live.<br /> Somehow, to its credit, the movie comes off light despite<br /> a fairly depressing theme.</p>  <p>Leaving the theater and returning to my car, <br /> I see the same itinerant men, at the same location,<br /> in their same positions, as when I saw them earlier<br /> in the evening. Only now it is night, a November,<br /> Montreal night, the wind coming up Ste-Catherine<br /> Street like a two-fisted pug, the storefronts electric,<br /> the traffic alive and desperate. I&rsquo;m here with Gerard,<br /> in a smoke filled dance hall, backup singers in place,<br /> band poised to play, my microphone in hand, ready<br /> to sing all the French love songs that I never knew existed.</p>  <p>And sing, like a Yankee gigolo in a Paris caf√©.</p>  <p>(<em>The Dalhousie Review)</em> </p>
