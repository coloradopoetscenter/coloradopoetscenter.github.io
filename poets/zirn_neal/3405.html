  <h1>3405 Gates Place</h1>  <p>I was in a strange mood, <br />
hopped in my Pontiac,<br />
kept my foot to the pedal,<br />
and headed downstate<br />
to my old neighborhood<br />
in the Bronx, New York.</p>  <p>I got off the Major Deegan <br /> Expressway near Van Cortlandt<br /> Park, whipped by Woodlawn<br /> Cemetery, onto Jerome Avenue,<br /> took a right at Gun Hill Road,<br /> hung a left on Gates Place,<br /> and parked at the end of the block<br /> in front of 3405, my old apartment <br /> building. </p>  <p>I ran up the four flights of stairs,<br /> and knocked on the door of my<br /> former residence, where I spent <br /> the first seven years of my life.<br /> An aged man, with a gray moustache,<br /> and long hair, an Albert Einstein<br /> look-alike, opened the door. It was myself,<br /> twenty-five years from now. </p>  <p>I asked myself what I was doing<br /> in the apartment I grew up in.<br /> I answered myself by saying, <br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here for the end of your<br /> life, back where you started,<br /> in order to complete the cycle.&rdquo;</p>  <p>I invited myself in, and we sat<br /> down at the old dining room table,<br /> the one from my childhood. We<br /> had a cup of coffee together,<br /> and talked about the future,<br /> and what we would be doing<br /> when we left this life. </p>  <p>I asked myself if I wanted<br /> to stay overnight, but I said<br /> to myself that I had to get back<br /> home. I asked if I could see my<br /> bedroom one last time, before<br /> I left, and I said, &ldquo;Yes, it would<br /> be alright.&rdquo; I went to the window,<br /> the one with the fire escape, and <br /> looked out, once more, at Mosholu<br /> Park, and beyond, to DeWitt Clinton<br /> High School and its magnificent dome.</p>  <p>My hair felt as if it could be on fire,<br /> such was the intensity of what I was feeling.</p>  <p>I noticed a flock of birds flying south<br /> for the winter, while at that same moment<br /> I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was myself,<br /> letting me know it was time to go.<br /> I turned and stared into my eyes,<br /> looking to see if there was something else<br /> to experience. But there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>  <p>(<em>Barbaric Yawp)</em></p>
