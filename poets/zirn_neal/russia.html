<h1>On Going to Russia to Adopt a Child </h1>  <p>I said I&rsquo;d go with her to the Mohawk Smoke Shop<br />
to buy cigarettes, Marlboro being the brand of choice.<br />
Cartons of them. They were cheaper on the Rez.</p>  <p>&ldquo;You need them to bribe the officials with,&rdquo; <br /> she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they told me at the agency.<br /> And I also have to bring 10,000 dollars in United<br /> States currency. I bought a money belt to wear under<br /> my blouse so I can hide all that cash when I go.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Besides buying the cigarettes, she picked up<br /> some trinkets to use as gifts. When we got back<br /> to my place, I carefully stacked the cartons <br /> of smokes on the kitchen table. They reminded<br /> me of boxed ammunition, ready to be used<br /> whenever necessary.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Still sure you don&rsquo;t want to go with me?&rdquo; <br /> she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Even though I&rsquo;m part Italian, it was another<br /> offer that was easy to refuse. &ldquo;Have to work, babe.<br /> Can&rsquo;t afford to take time off. You know that.<br /> We&rsquo;ve talked about it.&rdquo;</p>  <p>&ldquo;<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a>I know, but well, I&rsquo;d really like you  to come along.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Outside some jerk was screeching his tires,<br /> and in some other world, that I imagined as being<br /> next door, we were definitely having a different <br /> conversation. She was a single woman who wanted<br /> to be a mother, so much so, that she said, &ldquo;Waiting <br /> to adopt a child was almost like being pregnant.&rdquo;</p>  <p>I sat down for a minute, closed my eyes, <br /> and considered my reply. If I wasn&rsquo;t careful, <br /> pretty soon she&rsquo;d be sitting on my lap and calling me <em>daddy</em>.</p>  <p>(2012 Allen Ginsberg Poetry Contest Honorable Mention and  published in <em>Paterson Literary Review</em>)</p>
