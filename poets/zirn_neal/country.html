<h1>Country Boy </h1>  <p>She said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it.<br />
I never met anyone like you; <br />
I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t like nature?&rdquo;</p>  <p>And that&rsquo;s when I thought about <br /> my living in the country, and how I<br /> much preferred the police sirens<br /> that woke me up in the Bronx<br /> to the <em>damn them to  hell</em> coyotesÂ  <br /> that did the same thing, but kept on <br /> at it and never stopped howling.<br /> And how the exhaust fumes from<br /> the city buses smelled bad, but the crap<br /> they spread, to make things grow<br /> on the farm next door, smelled worse.<br /> And how my eyes puffed-up, and my nose<br /> ran during allergy season here, like it was<br /> racing at the Olympics, which is something<br /> that never happened when I lived downstate.</p>  <p>And so, I continued to ruminate like a man<br /> caught on a turntable. Then, with all this pecking<br /> at my mind, I bent down and looked with care<br /> into the face of the woman I call the Belle <br /> of Northern New York, the one with the gap <br /> between her two front teeth, and the sweet blue <br /> eyes I once said were hazel, and, after all this<br /> due consideration, answered, &ldquo;Honey, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>  <p>(<em>Blueline)</em></p>
