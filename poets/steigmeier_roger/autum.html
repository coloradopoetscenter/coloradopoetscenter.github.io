  <h1>Autum's Witness</h1>  <p> (  A poetic impression of Gustav Mahler&rsquo;s 9th Symphony)</p>  <p>Evening  approached<br />
with a  soft slow pulse<br /> <br /> daylight  fell into <br />  a reverie  of long shadows</p>
<p> stretching  across an open meadow.</p>  <p> An old  watcher was stirred<br /> from his  quiet contemplation</p>  <p> as a  sudden wind rose.</p>  <p> His aging  heart soared<br /> like  windblown leaves</p>  <p> up over  trembling branches</p>  <p> and  swaying tree tops.</p>  <p> He was in  flight<br /> <br /> moving toward a wide swath <br /> of yellow crimson cloud</p>  <p>struck into final  brilliance<br /> by a disappearing sun.</p>  <p>His eyes were filled<br /> with the fiery afterglow</p>  <p>but he knew that<br /> he could not hold back</p>  <p>the night</p>  <p>old night</p>  <p>fertile void</p>  <p>home of all passing  splendor.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Like the natural world<br /> around him</p>  <p>he, too, was at the  equinox<br /> in the full deep color</p>  <p>of his last years.</p>  <p>His memory took him away<br /> from the scene before him</p>  <p>and he was back <br /> in the rush and bother</p>  <p>of his working life</p>  <p>struggling and succeeding</p>  <p>sometimes failing</p>  <p>always moving forward<br /> toward some goal</p>  <p>that, once attained,</p>  <p>seemed only to lead<br /> toward another end</p>  <p>that became one more</p>  <p>starting point.</p>  <p>He shook his head:</p>  <p><em>Did any of it really  matter</em><br />  <em>or make  any difference?</em> </p>  <p><em>Was it all just a  fascinating distraction</em><br />  <em>a sometimes elegant</em></p>  <p><em>amusement?</em></p>  <p>He had no answer. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The twilight was turning<br />  into darkness;</p>  <p>soon the forest and meadow<br /> would vanish from his  sight.</p>  <p>He would not rage <br /> against the dying</p>  <p>of the light</p>  <p>old night was home<br /> to all splendor</p>  <p>and the light.</p>  <p>He would go home then</p>  <p>oh so gently</p>  <p>home.</p>
