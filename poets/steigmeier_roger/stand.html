              <h1>The Last Stand</h1>
              <p><strong> ( In lower Manhattan, along Houston  Street, there
  is a 25 by 40 foot  enclosure that is a &ldquo;living monument
  to the forest that once blanketed  Manhattan Island.&rdquo; It is
              an authentic re-creation of the  wild, inhabited for centuries
              by native tribes like the Lenni  Lenape and the Canarsie, people
              who suffered forced re-location  into areas far removed from their
              ancestral lands.)</strong></p>
              <p>Would anyone  notice<br />
                the sudden extra  glow</p>
              <p>of the wild  flowers</p>
              <p>at the south end  of the enclosure?</p>
              <p>A passerby might  muse <br />
                on the radiance</p>
              <p>and find it to  be <br />
                nothing more</p>
              <p>than an effect  of summer twilight.</p>
              <p>but the tribal  spirits <br />
                knew better.</p>
              <p>The shining  blossoms<br />
                poking through</p>
              <p>the chain link  fence</p>
              <p>had channeled  the Lenni Lenape<br />
                and Canarsie</p>
              <p>fishermen and  hunters</p>
              <p>from the old  Sapokanican</p>
              <p>the sandy hills <br />
                known as  Mannahatta.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The long red  diaspora<br />
                was over now;</p>
              <p>the birch trees <br />
                and hazel nut  shrubs</p>
              <p>knew it;</p>
              <p>the white ash  and elm<br />
                knew it;</p>
              <p>the black  cherry, witch hazel<br />
                and pokeweed  knew it.</p>
              <p>The tribes were  home again<br />
                even in this  tiny rectangle</p>
              <p>surrounded by  asphalt, tar<br />
                concrete and  brick.</p>
              <p>Any truck fumes <br />
                that strayed  into</p>
              <p>the enchanted  space<br />
                and air</p>
              <p>got absorbed</p>
              <p>by primal  fragrances;</p>
              <p>any shard or  scrap<br />
                of industrial  waste</p>
              <p>from the outside  world</p>
              <p>was quickly  broken down<br />
                and restored </p>
              <p>to its natural  state.</p>
              <p>Only a rare  passerby</p>
              <p>perhaps a gypsy</p>
              <p>descendant of mojo  women</p>
              <p>or psychic  sensitive</p>
              <p>knew that the  strange gleam<br />
                in the heart</p>
              <p>of a morning  glory</p>
              <p>&nbsp;become moon flower</p>
              <p>was more than  just<br />
                the luminous  touch</p>
              <p>of gloaming.</p>
              <p>Within this  small stretch<br />
                of enclosed wild</p>
              <p>this last stand<br />
                of a lost world</p>
              <p>the grandfathers  had returned.</p>
