  <h1 >Songs Over America</h1>  <p> ( For Harold Arlen, Hoagy Carmichael, Yip  Harburg, the Gershwins and Johnny Mercer) </p>  <p>Night fell on the long rows<br />  across the fields;</p>  <p>chants and laments<br /> could be heard </p>  <p>almost up to the porches<br /> of the great houses.</p>  <p>The sounds of voices <br /> fell just short</p>  <p>of the tall white columns;</p>  <p>cries and shouts<br /> landed in the shadows</p>  <p>of surrounding willows</p>  <p>that bent their branches<br /> down</p>  <p>to console the fallen  lamentations.</p>  <p>Down on the shadowed ground<br /> old slave chants</p>  <p>writhed in darkness<br /> and became ghosts</p>  <p>that rose up in ragtime<br /> and Delta blues</p>  <p>fully reborn in rhythm<br /> and rhyme.</p>  <p>By the second decade<br /> of the 20th century</p>  <p>sons of shtetl survivors<br /> from Europe and Russia</p>  <p>merged their musical vision </p>  <p>with African syncopation<br /> in a brilliant confluence</p>  <p>of style and emotion.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ballads in the gloaming</p>  <p>blues in the night<br /> and a memory </p>  <p>of love&rsquo;s refrain;</p>  <p>the music<br /> of the years</p>  <p>gone by</p>  <p>all flying high<br /> like a bluebird</p>  <p>over a rainbow.</p>  <p>Was there ever a paradise<br /> where roses grew</p>  <p>or was it all in the songs<br /> that soared above</p>  <p>the long enduring follies</p>  <p>of the joker and the thief?</p>  <p><em>I hear America singing</em><br /> sang the poet</p>  <p>and the melodious songs<br /> took flight--</p>  <p>the carols of the common folk<br /> born out of despair</p>  <p>and rising hope.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Across decades of war<br /> and deprivation</p>  <p>consolation was in<br /> the stardust of a song</p>  <p>and radios were on late<br /> in cold and desolated cities</p>  <p>or in lonely farmhouses<br /> whose fields were fallow</p>  <p>and barren.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Strange howÂ  piano pounders<br /> in a place called </p>  <p>Tin Pan Alley</p>  <p>could wrest great melody<br /> out of sweat</p>  <p>and stale tobacco smoke</p>  <p>spilled beer and liquor<br /> turned sour</p>  <p>in the small hours<br /> before sunrise.</p>  <p>Strange how lyricists<br /> could write pure poetry</p>  <p>for all those airborne melodies;</p>  <p>words and music<br /> away above the chimney tops.</p>  <p>all in search of</p>  <p>a land way up  high <br /> that was heard of</p>  <p>once in a lullaby.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>We are America singing</em><br /> sang the troubadours</p>  <p>of cigarets that bore<br /> a lipstick&rsquo;s traces</p>  <p>and tickets to romantic places.</p>  <p>O how the ghosts of you cling</p>  <p>song men;</p>  <p>your melodies haunt our reveries</p>  <p>and though they may seem to be<br /> so many foolish things</p>  <p>they can still lift us up <br /> to the moon river</p>  <p>just around the bend</p>  <p>to the place where rainbows end.</p>
