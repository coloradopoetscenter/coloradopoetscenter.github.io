  <h1>Brinkmanship</h1>  <p>It  is an old threshold<br/>this  self of mine</p>  <p>a  precipice and perch</p>  <p>where  I have been<br/>poised  and paused</p>  <p>for  too many years</p>  <p>stalled  in self-defeat.</p>  <p>Unlike  many <br/>of  my kind</p>  <p>I  have had both <br/>the  experience</p>  <p>and  the meaning</p>  <p>exulting  in <br/>an  autumn sunset</p>  <p>or  a flock of doves<br/>suddenly  risen</p>  <p>and  fleeting moments<br/>when  the One<br/>that  I have always been</p>  <p>smiled  and beckoned.</p>  <p>Now  as winter solstice<br/>comes  round again</p>  <p>I  will take one step<br/>over  the threshold</p>  <p>as  I usually do<br/>in  the season </p>  <p>of  light&rsquo;s return</p>  <p>one  step into the place<br/>that  is no place.</p>  <p>Retreat  will occur<br/>as  it always does</p>  <p>when  the mask<br/>loses  transparency.</p>  <p>So  I will remain<br/>on  the brink again</p>  <p>my  failed will <br/>and  courage</p>  <p>driving  me back<br/>to  place and time</p>  <p>and  person.</p>  <p>There  is some solace<br/>in  verse</p>  <p>the  tremulous pointing<br/>beyond  all maps</p>  <p>into  a territory<br/>I  may someday trod.</p>  <p>Until  and until<br/>and  until</p>  <p>I  will scrawl out<br/>these  lines</p>  <p>that  shine with the <br/>heart&rsquo;s  one true desire</p>  <p>the  soul&rsquo;s imploring plea.</p>
