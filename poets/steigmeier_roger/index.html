              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>Roger Steigmeier is a resident of  Northern Colorado, has an MA in English Education from NYU and has taught in  several colleges.&nbsp; He has one full volume  of published verse (<em>Light Traveling Dark  Traveling Light, </em>First East Coast Theater and Publishing Company, 1984) and  has numerous publishing credits, including poems published in <em>Dog River Review, POET, Pegasus, Many Waters </em>and<em> Mobius.</em> (He served as an  associate editor of the latter publication.)&nbsp;  He has been a member of Poets and Writers, Inc. since
1984.&nbsp;  Mr. Steigmeier is listed in <em>Who's  Who In America.</em></p>
              <p>Mr. Steigmeier is currently seeking a  publisher for two book-length works of cultural analysis. The first is titled <em>Ideology and Transcendence: A Study of  Western Systems of Thought from a Transpersonal Perspective. </em>The second is <em>The Amfortas Legacy: The Fate of the Hero in  American Literature. </em>Both studies extend on the seminal work of Joseph  Campbell and Ken Wilber, in particular the idea that human evolution is  incomplete&nbsp; without a general shift in  consciousness to what are called transegoic levels.&nbsp; Continuing failure to realize this shift has  led to a central crisis that plays out into all fields of human experience and  endeavor.</p>
              <p>                The first book examines this crisis in  terms of various political,
religious and economic ideologies, all  of which are understood to
be compensatory systems that attempt  to make up for the failure to evolve psycho-spiritually.&nbsp; The study shows how these systems have all  failed to resolve the crisis and have actually worsened it.&nbsp; The second book looks at how the crisis and its  failed attempts at a solution have been depicted through certain stories and  leading characters of 19th and 20th century American literature.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steigmeier's latest verse collection is a work in progress titled<em>The Book of </em>Gaia<em>, </em>a celebration of the Great Goddess, of whom Marija Gimbutas wrote in her several books on the old matrifocal culture that once flourished in southeastern Europe.The Goddess is a symbol of an egalitarian, peaceful culture that extolled art and philosophy and regarded women as equals in all facets of life. Steigmeier's poems are an anticipation and a hope that such a culture could be reborn.            </p>
