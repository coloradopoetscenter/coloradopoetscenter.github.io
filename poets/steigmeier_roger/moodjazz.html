          <h1>Mood Jazz New York          </h1>
          <p> Half  Note Café</p>
          <p>Thelonious<br />
            comes  in late<br />
            <br />
          coat half off</p>
          <p>cigarette  burned down<br />
            to his fingers .</p>
          <p>Monk</p>
          <p>bends over the  keyboard</p>
          <p>plays entire set<br />
            with one hand.</p>
          <p>Miles</p>
          <p>surly and  impatient</p>
          <p>trying to milk  the mic<br />
            for a ballad</p>
          <p>whose sound<br />
            he can&rsquo;t get  right.</p>
          <p>Miles</p>
          <p>angry and tired</p>
          <p>1:00 AM<br />
            at the Vanguard</p>
          <p>Miles pulls the  mute<br />
            off his horn</p>
          <p>throws it across  the stand</p>
          <p>snaps his  fingers</p>
          <p>sextet comes in<br />
            with blues red  hot</p>
          <p>and fast.</p>
          <p>Audience looks  like<br />
            they have been  hit</p>
          <p>by lightning.</p>
          <p>Sonny Rollins</p>
          <p>comes out of the  Five Spot Café<br />
            kitchen</p>
          <p>doodling  aimlessly<br />
            on his sax</p>
          <p>goes on for some  time.</p>
          <p>Finally</p>
          <p>he breaks out  into <br />
  &ldquo;Three Little  Words&rdquo;</p>
          <p>group joins in</p>
          <p>audience  whistles<br />
            and applauds.</p>
          <p>Jazz is night  music</p>
          <p>Jazz is straight  no chaser<br />
            at the Village  Gate</p>
          <p>jazz is a black  woman</p>
          <p>super fox<br />
            in diamonds and  furs</p>
          <p>leaning forward<br />
            to get a light</p>
          <p>for her English  Oval.</p>
          <p>Eyes watch her<br />
            sip a martini</p>
          <p>slowly lick her  lips</p>
          <p>take a drag<br />
            on her  cigarette.</p>
          <p>Smoke curls  around <br />
            her face</p>
          <p>she smiles.</p>
          <p>Jazz is a rhythm<br />
            a joy</p>
          <p>jazz beats time</p>
          <p>beats pain and  loss.</p>
          <p>Jazz is a life</p>
          <p>outside of life</p>
