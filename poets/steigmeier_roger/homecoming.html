  <h1>The Last Homecoming</h1>  <p>Â  <br /> (This poem was greatly  inspired by the music of  Paul Winter, whose piece titled &ldquo;Grand Canyon Sunset&rdquo;  always gives me a strong sense of homecoming.)<br /> <br /> <em>i.  Pre-amble</em><br /> <br /> Follow  the echoing tones<br /> <br /> beyond the  stratified rock<br />  and sun rouged  stones</p>  <p> even beyond that  second star<br />  on the right</p>  <p>leading straight on  &lsquo;til morning.</p>  <p>Some might say that<br />  at age seventy</p>  <p>I have a strong  sense <br /> of home<br /> <br /> being the impending <br />  earthen receiver </p>  <p>of my bones</p>  <p>or the elysian domain<br /> of my released spirit.</p>  <p>That all will come</p>  <p>but it is not here and  now. </p>  <p>The here and now <br /> is my journey</p>  <p>and my destination.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>ii. Sojourner</em></p>  <p>Who will walk a path</p>  <p>past nameless pine groves <br /> along pristine mountain  streams?</p>  <p>What past life <br /> will be carried within him</p>  <p>what future hopes<br /> or concerns</p>  <p>will urge him on?</p>  <p>Who will linger on an old  stump<br /> with a late afternoon sun</p>  <p>softy beaming through<br /> dry cool air?</p>  <p>Will he be as light<br /> as the air itself</p>  <p>and as radiant <br /> as the last red rays</p>  <p>of the setting sun?</p>  <p>If a passing stranger<br /> asks him </p>  <p>who he is</p>  <p>will his answer be</p>  <p><em>I don&rsquo;t know.</em></p>  <p>Will he laugh at<br /> his response</p>  <p>will he know then<br /> that before his dust</p>  <p>has been commingled<br /> with the earth</p>  <p>and before his soul <br /> has ascended to Elysium</p>  <p>that he has </p>  <p>at last</p>  <p>come home?</p>
