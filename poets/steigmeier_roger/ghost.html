<h1>Ghost Orchid</h1>
<p><strong> (The ghost orchid does not grow in  soil. It isa species of  orchid that grows on trees. The ghost orchidblends  so well with the tree bark that the striking white flower appears to be  suspended in midair.&nbsp; While the flower is  in bloom, the giant sphinx moth pollinates it, thus insuring its survival.) </strong></p>
<p>Even in the dim lunar glow<br />of a half moon</p>
<p>the seraphim is radiant</p>
<p>a divine spectral presence<br />suspended in a summer night.</p>
<p>Only in disenchanted daylight<br />are its roots visible--</p>
<p>green cords wrapped around<br />a tree.</p>
<p>surviving only on what<br />its air born lover</p>
<p>brings it.</p>
<p>Strange angel, then<br />that must wait </p>
<p>for penetration</p>
<p>from a winged creature.<br />that was once </p>
<p>an earthbound crawler.</p>
<p>Anxious angel, too<br />that longs for night</p>
<p>so that it can dream again<br />of being free </p>
<p>of roots and tree</p>
<p>and its moth consort</p>
<p>dream of taking flight<br />into the firmament</p>
<p>into the charmed embrace<br />of the stars</p>
<p>and the cool caress</p>
<p>of moonbeams.</p>
