<h1>Mt. St. Helens </h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (erupted May 1980)</p>
<p>Tagged  salmon avoided the ash-filled Cowlitz<br />showed up  at the next clear river,<br />the Kalama.  Only weeks later<br />fresh  animal tracks were seen&mdash;<br />where did  they come from?<br />Shoots of  pearly everlasting,<br />horsetail  rushes, beargrass, fireweed,<br />pushed  through crusty layers of ash.<br />Underground  animals&mdash;pocket gophers,<br />mice, and  ants&mdash;survived the blanket<br />of  sulphurous ash, no one knows how.<br />Perhaps  tunnels trapped oxygen<br />as divers  know spaces in our bodies <br />hold air.  How different from what we told<br />ourselves  when we saw the blackened sky<br />in full  day: &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo;<br />we said and  moved about numb,<br />already  mourning, not yet for our children<br />or  ourselves but for things<br />we didn&rsquo;t  know we loved: the worn path<br />beneath  lines of drying sheets<br />  now gray  with fallen ash.</p>
