              <h1>When we were in Delft </h1>
              <p>water  shadows on stone on stucco<br />
                dishes and  silver clacking in kitchens<br />
                every house  had a boat tethered<br />
                we had to  figure out which bridge to cross<br />
                and how the  square<br />
                opened to  sky the cathedral at the north end<br />
                we climbed  a ladder lowered from the eaves<br />
                and the  deep bells woke us<br />
                but we  didn&rsquo;t mind<br />
                we could  see from the top<br />
                roof beyond  roof and knew tiny black figures<br />
                below were  tourists the Dutch rode bicycles<br />
                everything  was blue and white<br />
                when we  were in Delft  still in love<br />
                and the  cobbled square<br />
                and the  cheeses and beer were not symbols<br />
                even the  cold rain later blue and white sky<br />
          meant what  it meant.              </p>
