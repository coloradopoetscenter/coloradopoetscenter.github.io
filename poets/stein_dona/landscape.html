<h1>Landscape with Bride</h1>
<p>Before an  unintended war, she tends<br />
to details:  is the church ready<br />
where are  the rings? The floating</p>
<p>homunculus  curls into its body<br />abstract  for her; and the man<br />dressed in  rented white? Not ready<br />for war or  domestic trouble<br />  his dim  fears that women unsex men</p>
<p>Things that  cost money worry him<br />yet there&rsquo;s  some saving with the old:<br />her  grandmother&rsquo;s pearls, his<br />great-grandfather&rsquo;s  ring, its worn gold<br />  and stamped  dates&mdash;how did it survive</p>
<p>its centuries?  As war works closer<br />to their  lives the groom&rsquo;s restless<br />nagged by  green in the hills<br />of a late  Northern spring&nbsp;&nbsp; She greets him<br />  under her  mother&rsquo;s apple tree in bloom</p>
<p>She is  clear to him. He wants only<br />to make her  happy. Yes, her joy<br />will address  his doubt&nbsp;&nbsp; he will feel<br />  comforted&nbsp;&nbsp; pleased&nbsp;&nbsp;  this <em>is</em> what he wants</p>
<p>He looks up  through rings<br />of shadowed  green&nbsp;&nbsp; sees tree limbs<br />crossed  like scissors<br />  his hand  moves to hers&nbsp;&nbsp; gloved&nbsp;&nbsp; white</p>
