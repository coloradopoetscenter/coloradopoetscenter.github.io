<h1>In Munich</h1>
<p>she watches  the pictures<br />
as she sits  all day long by herself<br />
in a  kitchen of cockroaches<br />
shooting  themselves in the arms</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s the  kids shooting themselves<br />in the  arms, ankles, or between<br />their  fingers, behind their testicles<br />  breathing  fumes no longer enough</p>
<p>she  shouldn&rsquo;t watch them like they&rsquo;re pictures<br />out of tune  they sing what might be<br />&ldquo;You Are My  Sunshine&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; redolent spring morning<br />  fruit trees  humming at once&nbsp;&nbsp; apricot cherry</p>
<p>apple  plum&nbsp;&nbsp; is it latent wop syndrome<br />to wonder  about the Germans&nbsp;&nbsp; she thinks<br />part German  herself&nbsp;&nbsp; the Jewish part<br />  maybe the  Italian part too&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;alles fur</p>
<p>meinen  Kindern&rdquo; that&rsquo;s what they always said<br />whether  German&nbsp; Italian&nbsp; French&nbsp;&nbsp;  probably<br />Chinese  too&nbsp;&nbsp; she still walks in the history<br />  of her  people&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever they are they pushed</p>
<p>out of  customs stumbling&nbsp;&nbsp; legs numb<br />eyes and  hands cast down wondering<br />where they  were in kitchens with cockroaches<br />  shooting  themselves in the arms&nbsp;&nbsp; no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the kids  who do the cha-cha-cha&nbsp; revive the twist<br />all night  in tight black jeans&nbsp;&nbsp; then shoot<br />themselves  up&nbsp; they squat on the edge<br />  of Munich&nbsp;&nbsp; she sits all day long by herself</p>
<p>she wants  to ask you Herr Announcer<br />on TV&nbsp;&nbsp; what a German is<br />why only  Jews can be Israeli<br />  but that&rsquo;s  bad to ask</p>
<p>now they  with their homeland and Palestinians<br />none&nbsp; though last year&rsquo;s el nino caused this year&rsquo;s<br />explosive  spring&nbsp;&nbsp; kids still sing of peace&nbsp; love<br />all the  fruit trees in tune at once<br />  sing  cherry&nbsp; apple&nbsp; apricot&nbsp;  plum.</p>
