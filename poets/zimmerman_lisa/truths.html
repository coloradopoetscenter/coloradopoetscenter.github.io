  <h1>Truths</h1>
<p>There is a river of grief beneath the world.<br />Horses remember the rumble of dinosaurs.<br />My boy grew an inch in less than a month.<br />My husband was a boy once with a poem in his pocket.<br />Bales of sweet grass wear down in the barn<br />to give room to the cat, to give room<br />to the mice.<br />Under the lake there are turtles. Under the lake<br />there are mysteries. The lake knows<br />all about the river of grief.</p>
