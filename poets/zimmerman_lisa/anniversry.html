  <h1>Anniversary</h1>
<p>Twenty sweet years or mostly<br />not to mention the occasional evening split</p>
<p>by cool stars remote and separate above the house<br />  or somebody&rsquo;s willowed tears, the weeks</p>
<p>rained over us, beyond us even<br />  in drought the wick of our youth</p>
<p>burned steadily down into our bodies.<br />  There is no hiding the love we&rsquo;ve sewn</p>
<p>into the squared quilt of this marriage&mdash;<br />  long blue nights stitched into days full</p>
<p>or difficult or ordinary like the dozen<br />  tiny wrens on the wire this fresh morning.</p>
