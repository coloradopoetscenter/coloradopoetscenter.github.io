          <h1>Lies</h1>
              <p>The sun is a broken window on fire.<br />
                The stars speak the color of my real name.<br />
  Angels whisper <em>Osama Osama</em> in their sleep.<br />
  The dog&rsquo;s bones gleam in the dark.<br />
  The dark is the underside of God&rsquo;s one eyelid.<br />
  Hearts are like the sun only not on fire<br />
  Or do I mean not like a window<br />
  Or do I mean green glass you can see through?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
