  <h1>Hillcrest Drive, Albuquerque</h1>
<p>There was the front walk, hot cement<br />leading past the pebbled landscape<br />a fringe of scratchy junipers<br />with their blue poison orbs.<br />There were the double front doors <br />of dark wood which might open <br />to a living room <br />where no one lived, arched <br />and obedient furniture matching <br />the imperious dining room table <br />whose water rings boiled <br />our mother to a rage.<br />There were sliding glass doors <br />along the concrete back porch<br />where we could see the neighbor&rsquo;s yard <br />and their small springing dog <br />on his thin tether<br />whom they surely loved more<br />than our parents loved us.<br />There was the fall of seventh grade<br />when mononucleosis wore me down <br />to utter nothing, closed my throat <br />and flung me into sweaty nightmares<br />one where I saw my sleeping sister <br />sawed in half on wooden planks <br />by anonymous workers <br />in the neighbor&rsquo;s garden.<br />I fevered awake at dawn and stood <br />a long time staring through the paned glass<br />to the vacant day outside, everyone&rsquo;s yard <br />cool and quiet, the relentless New Mexican sun<br />not yet burning the day into submission.<br />And me, in a large empty house <br />all of thirteen and shivering<br />with a strangled swollen neck<br />powerless to swallow my own spit.</p>
