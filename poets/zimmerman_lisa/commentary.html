<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p align="left"><strong>on <em>How the Garden Looks From Here</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lisa Zimmerman's poems there is much sorrow, often hinted and muted, but there is more joy, spoken and sung. The speaker in these poems loves her children, the sky, the lake, and her horses. She lives in the world as if it's the only one; the things of her life matter&mdash;the worth of each blade of grass, each bird, each dream, each word is tangible, weighted, and given to us in a poetry measured and strong.&mdash;Rick Campbell</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <em>How the Garden Looks from Here</em>, Lisa Zimmerman's poems resonate, often like Van Gogh paintings. They open for the presence of magpies in a cornfield, for the son who is &ldquo;not afraid when he wakes,&rdquo; for the hour filled &ldquo;with wet boots and socks and black paws.&rdquo; &nbsp;They tap into archetypal sense, and their powered imagery expresses primal synergy with irreplaceable constituents of the natural world.&mdash;James Grabill</p>
