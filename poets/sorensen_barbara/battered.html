  <h1>Battered</h1>  <p>Those boys must have learned <br />  to bear the Wyoming wind <br />  from snow fences bent along <br />  the highway, <br />  from fields <br />  flat as their eyes <br />  no asylum, <br />  from tides of antelope <br />  skirring through frozen needle-and-thread, <br />  followed by the scud of grifters, <br />  hypothermic vultures. <br />  Beating <br />  him to death, <br />  they were like children <br />  who had learned <br />  first the burn of wind, <br />  then to turn a cold cheek, <br />  hands cupping ears <br />  blocking the sound <br />  of a wind with no beginning, no end. <br />  They kept at it <br />  how many times <br />  they canâ€™t remember <br />  only that he had always been with them, <br />  part of that wind, <br />  the one  intimate sibling.</p>
