          <h1>Reading Italy </h1>
          <p>            In  memory of Larry Levis</p>
          <p>And I am not what happens next<br />
            though I have come again with my broken music<br />
            to brutal Italy, <br />
            to faint rain and Rome, <br />
            to the Piazza di Espagna <br />
          and Keats’ narrow room.</p>
          <p>Come again as if to please <br />
            whatever is pleased by repetition— <br />
            dogs, god, priests and votive nuns. </p>
          <p>Come again like one devoted<br />
            to the wake of things, <br />
            to look down from this window <br />
            in the air of a sick man’s room<br />
            just above the eternal moil of commerce <br />
            and the sepulcher-white steps.</p>
          <p>And I return in pieces now<br />
            my life lashed to lives that have fallen away<br />
            and given their shadows to stones.<br />
            All of my life, a losing autumn.</p>
          <p>I will make the walk to the cemetery—<br />
            Protestant cats for my graveyard guides.</p>
          <p>I reach through a fine net of rain,<br />
            touch the ruined harp on his grave.<br />
            And I am not what happens next.</p>
          <p align="center">***</p>
          <p>Across theses tiled roofs, old TV.  antennas  <br />
            like a graveyard of fish bones. </p>
          <p>They all point in the same direction. <br />
            What river left them stranded here? <br />
            What signal now?</p>
          <p>Each night’s immigrants spread out <br />
            their white sheets in the campo like prayer rugs <br />
            and hawk their knock-off   Prada bags.<br />
            Each night the carabinieri arrive <br />
            to drive over the purses and beat the men away.</p>
          <p>We are never outside of the coliseum, I am thinking.</p>
          <p>In Venice, I snuff a candle at the  tomb<br />
            of Giovanni Pesaro, a nausea of gold mosaic.<br />
            He is held aloft in a tap dancer’s pose<br />
            on the backs of onyx-muscled slaves. </p>
          <p>Giovanni Pesaro waits in an ecstasy of waiting.<br />
            The slaves only wait. </p>
          <p align="center">***</p>
          <p>I should read to the birds like St. Augustine.<br />
            but I am not saint myself.</p>
          <p>Doves fly from the pleated Aegean<br />
            like a cloud of smoke from a distant war.<br />
            Hunger will have them in your hands.</p>
          <p>See them glide from the towers of St Peter’s<br />
            and try not to think of angels, <br />
            of white sparks from a flame.</p>
          <p>I have seen shopkeepers and tourists <br />
            lure them with breadcrumbs, lure them close <br />
            to crush them to delight the crowds.</p>
          <p>And I am not what happens next.<br />
            This is my answer when nothing calls me.</p>
          <p>I have seen noble Italian faces<br />
            tilted back to meet the sun like sundials <br />
            but the hour is the same.</p>
