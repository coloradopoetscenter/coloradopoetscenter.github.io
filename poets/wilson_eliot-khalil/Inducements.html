  <h1>Inducements </h1>  <p>We judge it high time for your own shadow.</p>  <p>You who were all lizard eyes and trout bones<br /> have zeppelined out, fat as a zoo sparrow,<br /> and managed to open the umbrella <br /> your mother inadvertently swallowed.</p>  <p>Sweet jumpy thing of water, come ashore.</p>  <p>The earth has cooled; the dinosaurs are gone <br /> mostly. The crocuses have burst open <br /> with the arms of vaudeville actors vying <br /> for their share of spotlight and applause. </p>  <p>Your furniture awaits largely assembled<br /> among antediluvian stacks of diapers,<br /> and I’ve learned two new chords on the ukulele</p>  <p>Tonight the thunder you hear rumbles a prelude. <br /> The house darkens, grows increasingly pink.</p>  <p>I sweep the floor with Art Blakey on the stereo <br /> playing what will be our song—Come Rain or Come Shine.</p>  <p>I sweep and sweep; he brushes the snare drum <br /> softer and softer . . .</p>  <p>(this is where you come in.)</p>
