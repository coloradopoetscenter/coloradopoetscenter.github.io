          <h1>Wedding  Vows          </h1>
          <p>…and I’d like  to add that I will mind like a dog.  I  will wear whatever you like.  I will go  wingtip.  No more white socks.  A necktie stitched to my throat, turtlenecks  in August. New York gray or black, only colors that dogs can see.   I will know of squash, vermouth, and  wedges.   I will do all the grilling  because I love it so.  I will drive the  wagon, man the bar, weed-whack compulsively.   I will make money, the bed, never a to do.  </p>
          <p>I will build  like an Egyptian, a two-mile pier complex,   a five-story deck.  I will listen  like a bat, attend to the birth of sounds in the back of your throat. I will  remember like an Indian elephant, recall requests made of me in a previous  life.  Your date of birth will be carved  in the palm of my hand.  I will make  good. I will do right.  I will sleep on  the pegboard on the wall in the garage. </p>
          <p>I’ll have a tongue like a sperm whale, eyes like a harp  seal, biceps like a fiddler crab.  I will  have gold coins, gold rings, stiff gold hair like shredded wheat.  I will be golden at receptions, gold in your  pocket, Paganini in your pants. Money will climb over the house like ivy.  Excellent credit will be my white whale.  I will always. I will everyday. I will nail  the seat down.  I will let you pretend I  am your father.</p>
          <p>I will be a priapic automatic teller machine, never down,  never a usage fee, a stock prophet, a para-mutual seer, tractable, worshipful  no matter what.  I will always want to. I  won’t notice what you don’t point out.  I  will entertain your friends, say how your love saved me. I will convince  them.  I will talk, really talk, to  them.  Deep meanings will be toothpicked  and passed around.  </p>
          <p>I will need zero maintenance. I will be a utility or a  railroad.  There will be no breakdowns or  disconnections. I will allow you lovers, Moroccan teenagers and Turkish  men.  I will adopt them. I will not  cry.  I will respond to grief by earning  more. My sweat will smell like drug money, like white bread baking. I will be  as clean as a Mormon, wholesome like Iowa.   I will lead.  I will be a star, a  rock, like Rock Hudson.</p>
