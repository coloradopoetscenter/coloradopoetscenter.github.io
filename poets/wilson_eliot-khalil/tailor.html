  <h1><strong>The Tailor of Al  Hamdaniyah</strong> </h1>  <p>Because he wore a suit and seemed <br /> of high-value and would name no terrorists, <br /> knowing none, they stripped and hooded the old man, <br /> the village tailor, and hung him by his wrists <br />  from a mulberry tree that grew by the river.</p>  <p>The old man knew only thank you and please<br /> in English which he said through the night <br /> to the sound of the Tigris and the sound of the wind.<br /> He hung from the tree, strange fruit, five days. </p>  <p>Piñata man or Muslim ham, the Americans called him<br /> and burned his feet with their lighters  <br /> when he seemed to sleep.</p>  <p>Five days it took for his brother to get word<br /> and travel to Mosul and bring his release<br /> but by then the hands of the tailor had ripened.</p>  <p>His hands had changed, like the fruit of the tree,<br /> from white to red to withered black and past saving.<br /> They carried him to the clinic and cut them off.</p>  <p>Nine hundred dollars they issued him,<br /> to which he said neither thank you nor please.</p>
