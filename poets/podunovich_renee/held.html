<h1>Held</h1>
<p> Held in open palms<br />shells of hummingbird egg <em>(archilochus alexandri)</em><br />dried seed pods of peony <em>(paeonia  lactiflora)</em><br />  the exoskeleton of praying mantis <em>(stagomantis carolina)</em>.</p>
<p>The palms are warm with life<br />because external husks such as <br /><em class="indent">thoughts,  personalities and bodies </em><br />are infused with core infernal heat.<br /><span class="indent">These palms touch you gently </span><br /><span class="indent">upon your heart</span><br />in the midst of huge space <br />where minute amounts of light congeal into molecules, <br />atoms, individual organs combine to form bodies, <br />now cognitions, emotions and behaviors-<br />  all in relation to each other.</p>
<p>Come spring, <br />this peony is more than <br />individual roots and blossoms, <br />it is black ants <em>(one  of more than 4500 species of ants)</em><br />climbing its long and full body<br />looking for sweet juices, <br />it is the rush of snowmelt <br />descending the thawing mountains, <br />the timid kiss of spring rains, <br />four generations of women <em>(homo sapiens sapiens)</em> <br />whose bare hands have transplanted and tended, <br />it is the hummingbird seeking nectar<br />in the lush folded labyrinth <br />of scented pink petals, <br />the ethereal praying mantis <br />hunting for aphids <br />  among the slender verdant leaves. </p>
<p>Beyond appearances, we are 99.9% light, <br />yet we are invisible without each other. <br />Our connection is a pattern <br />in the vastness of cosmic womb space,<br />our love is a molecular exchange<br /><span class="indent">across time and probability, </span><br />generated out of deep blue mystery, <br />alive and warm,<br />  <span class="indent">electric and fantastic.</span></p>
