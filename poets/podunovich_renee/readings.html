<h1>Readings / Workshop Availability</h1>
<p>Renee Podunovich, MA, National Certified Counselor, is  available to facilitate Transpersonal Poetry Workshops. She is a  psychotherapist as well as a published writer. Her workshops combine inner  exploration and growth group experiences with writing exercises. </p>
<p>Poetry has the power to remind us of our essential nature  within where we feel connected to all of life. It can move us beyond our  constricted sense of self and is a language that can describe and hold the  power of transcendent experiences. Renee creates a space in which it is safe to  journey inward, find what is meaningful and express our voice in poetry. This  is a poetry workshop that combines guided imagery and creative imagination with  writing exercises and poetic expression. </p>
