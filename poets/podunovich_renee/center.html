<h1>If There is a Center, No  One Knows Where it Begins</h1>
<p>The obsidian morning.<br />I hurl my heart out <br />into this incomprehensible starscape<br />and there it will reside a burning fire orb, <br /><span class="indent">blazing and consumed</span><br />  by the intensity of its aliveness.</p>
<p>Things are so far apart-<br />light years and galaxies,<br />your life and mine,<br /><span class="indent">yet this morning, </span><br />everything is suspended in the prehistoric dark<br />the thick lagoon of the cosmos,<br />aquatic universe, sparkling stillness, <br />quiet. Nothing <br /><span class="indent">but the churning mind,</span><br />nothing to do but sit as witness <br />to the rising and falling<br />the clinging and letting go<br />the chronic bubbling up and drifting away<br />  <span class="indent">of awareness.</span></p>
<p>If there is a core, a nucleus, a source, <br />Gaugy saw that some souls reach toward it,<br />some are stunned, frozen in reverence, <br />some contemplate the inferno from within, <br />others move away from the white heat of essence.<br />This morning, some are being born, <br /><span class="indent">some are dying, </span><br />some are casting a net of forgiveness over <br />  the sea of despair. </p>
<p>The sea like a tear<br />holds what is precious,<br />impossibly huge, I drink it<br />  <span class="indent">with a straw.</span></p>
