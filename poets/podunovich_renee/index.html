              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>Renee  Podunovich believes that poetry is a language that encourages us to transcend  our constricted sense of self and connect to our essential nature within and  the spirit of the world around us. Poetry speaks to a deep place within us that  experiences connection to all life. She writes about human experience in  relation to a living planet, looking for interconnections that are clear and  also hidden, just beyond the reach of language.</p>
              <p>Renee Podunovich lives near Dolores,  CO in an &ldquo;Earthship&rdquo; home. She is a certified herbalist and&nbsp;counselor,  with&nbsp;a private psychotherapy practice in Cortez. She is a member of  Growing Voices, a troupe of writers and performers in the Four Corners region.</p>
