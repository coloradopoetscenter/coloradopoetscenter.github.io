<h1>Critical Commentary:</h1>
<p> &ldquo;Renee Podunovich&rsquo;s visions are transparent panes allowing  the reader the warmth and light of a larger view. She returns from journeys  beyond the daily world with medicine which explodes in us &lsquo;with no limits,  other than the filter of our hearts&rsquo;. Her passionate words form conduits  through which we can meet our higher selves.&rdquo; Cynthia West, author, <em>Rainbringer and The New Sun</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Reading poems like &lsquo;Clearing,&rsquo; &lsquo;Heart Filter&rsquo;, is like  listening to soulful jazz- as if &lsquo;the shimmering, shining, shape-shifting/  light&rsquo; learned to play a grammar rag, just to cast &lsquo;the memoir of itself&rsquo;. Like  the redwoods and aspens she studies, Renee Podunovich traces patterns; her  consciousness and that of the trees, the ferns are one.&rdquo; Steve Lautermilch,  photographer, author, <em>Mirror Light</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She takes us traveling simultaneously inside and out;  noting, reporting on observations of the mystical experience and the natural in  the poetic company of her rational mind.&rdquo; Mead Bullington, Certified Instructor  Sheng Zhen Wuji Yuan. </p>
