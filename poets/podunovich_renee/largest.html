              <h1>The Hidden Largest</h1>
              <p>The largest mountain range <br />
                is under the Atlantic ocean.<br />
                It is one arm connected to oceanic ridges<br />
                in every ocean,<br />
                creating the longest mountain range in the world,<br />
                the deepest canyons,<br />
                the cause of Pangaea-<br />
                <span class="indent">80 million  years-</span><br />
                continents still drifting, friction,<br />
                unstable, plate tectonics, propagating<br />
          velocities, seismic migration.</p>
              <p>Migrating from mind to heart.<br />
                The heart with its rift valleys<br />
                its flooded and uncertain topography-<br />
                <span class="indent">a hand drawn map.</span><br />
                There are portions with enough elevation<br />
                to extend above the sea.<br />
                To navigate these, use a bearing compass,<br />
                <span class="indent">a nautical almanac and align </span><br />
                <span class="indent">with the magnetic poles and the  stars.</span><br />
                Know that the surface water<br />
                bulges outward and inward<br />
                mimicking the rough terrain below, <br />
                signs too small to be seen<br />
                <span class="indent">without measuring the altitude </span><br />
                <span class="indent">above the water</span><br />
                <span class="indent">from a satellite.</span><br />
                Forget your eyes altogether-<br />
                the mind can&rsquo;t swim.<br />
                To live in liquid use sound,<br />
                trace how voice and movement<br />
                bounce off the edges of the world-<br />
                returning and reverberating,<br />
                always measuring the distance <br />
          <span class="indent">between self and everything else. </span></p>
              <p>The small islands, hushed,<br />
                waves sighing as they encounter sand,<br />
                the groaning of heavy land masses in movement below,<br />
                <span class="indent">the Pangaea of the unified self-</span><br />
                <span class="indent">a jigsaw puzzle of transcendence</span><br />
                <span class="indent">and connection.</span><br />
                Sink blindly into immense spaces<br />
                where everything substantial<br />
                is weightless<br />
          under water.</p>
