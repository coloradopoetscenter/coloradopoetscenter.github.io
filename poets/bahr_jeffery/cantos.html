<h1>Jeffery Bahr </h1>




<p>One stanza written with a three-penny </p>
<p>on the hidden side of sheet rock &ndash; six weeks</p>
<p>stint in a Chelsea development, then shipped out</p>
<p>on a long shot, lines out to haddock,</p>
<p>taking leave from the hood of his sou&rsquo;wester, tacked</p>
<p>on to the last of his stanzas (gilled last</p>
<p>gasps), rap of the Atlantic</p>
<p>monthly over the gunwales, past the tops</p>
<p>of his galoshes, take and double take. Time </p>
<p>for an outer bridge, polished slope to </p>
<p>the dull interior, this new republic</p>
<p>blank blue, his mouth a monoplane.</p>
<p>Making plans (portside a prairie,</p>
<p>schooner in his lee, lines left</p>
<p>cockeyed on the bulkheads), something</p>
<p>involving the cross-connect of used brick</p>
<p>and the fricatives of Tampa, Nebraska. </p>
<p>Reviews his progress: She&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>dead and he&rsquo;s the clutch plate. Sulfur fringe,</p>
<p>birds gorging in the black eye &ndash; north </p>
<p>to the third coast, south to the levees, west</p>
<p>to how many mountains, moving against</p>
<p>such clouds or is it the clouds moving? Here&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>verse for their spindrift: <em>Stand from the fosse, </em></p>
<p><em>leave me my bloody bever</em>. He appropriates</p>
<p>half-built models in the bedrooms of the children</p>
<p>(stock cars, fighter planes) and the long-hauler</p>
<p>yells for a heavy piece for another tier, and he sleeps</p>
<p>beneath packing blankets, someone&rsquo;s squared-up possessions</p>
<p>headed for the borderlands, annotations</p>
<p>black on boxboard: <em>Second Bedroom, </em></p>
<p><em>Medicine Cabinet</em>. They rattle</p>
<p>in the throat of the road. They Morse</p>
<p>as she would have diddled lyrics </p>
<p>into jay-squawk. He the meat and she </p>
<p>the nerve, and what now, running </p>
<p>out of nation, only the desert</p>
<p>left. And the deep blue that the desert </p>
<p>dreams. And rocks that need rearranging.</p>
