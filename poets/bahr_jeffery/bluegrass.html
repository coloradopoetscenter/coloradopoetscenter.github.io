              <h1>The History of Bluegrass</h1>
              <p>The bees form a living mitt about the  aspen&rsquo;s narrow branch. </p>
              <p>A woman tilts her wrist and plays the  fiddle.</p>
              <p>They could become the glove of my  body.&nbsp; They could drown out<br />
                my voice with their hum. </p>
              <p>The woman never sings and plays in the  same instant.</p>
              <p>They are mainly brainless, and not  even<br />
                aerodynamic.&nbsp; They may have a taste for me.</p>
              <p>The Dobro moans.</p>
              <p>Or I could take a smoke pot and dress  up.&nbsp; Bees would wheel<br />
                like so many stars, falling to the  ground as constellations.</p>
              <p>There&rsquo;s reverie without them, and now  a banjo.</p>
              <p>Or I could collect them in plastic  bags and let them<br />
                inhabit an apple orchard.</p>
              <p>The woman moves on to a slow sad  ballad.<br />
                A pile of newspapers covers my lap.</p>
              <p>A few stragglers punctuate the chaise  lounge.&nbsp; They have lost<br />
                their love for big ideas.</p>
              <p> (from <em>Court  Green, Verse Daily)</em></p>
