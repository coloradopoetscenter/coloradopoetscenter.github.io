<h1>The Sisterhood of Saint Philomena</h1>

<p>A boy in her backyard is bending his head back to swallow the snow. </p>
<p>The roof moans and aspens sag under pleasant treachery. Now, the clapping, </p>
<p>the deconstruction of chalked apologies, an a cappella of wheels </p>
<p>on wet metal. The blizzard is up to his knees, but now </p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a sapling wrapped in plastic. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea&rdquo;, says Ms. Happy Hour, stabbing banderillas </p>
<p>into Jack cheese. A man demands red. When she was seven, </p>
<p>she made the crossing in the trunk of a Chrysler. She eyes the 17 </p>
<p>foot fir tree, gold swag, impaled cherub. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that&rdquo;, gripping his </p>
<p>Zinfandel. She spins on the lobby tile, floats above the atrium. </p>
<p>A krill run of headlights scatters down 101. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nearness, and her nerve fails. Hugging the emptiness, her fingers splay </p>
<p>on her own shoulder blades. Once, she thought love was a stutter. </p>
<p>Her mom was her dad, they formed a consonant. Every union slaps </p>
<p>the back of her knees. The first star surprises her. She can follow the line </p>
<p>of the broken mountains. They are magnificent. They will die in Wyoming. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The near oak and the far Arch, a milo field of raised clubs. This bridge </p>
<p>with one foot among stunted redbuds, stretching to train yards of tagged dyslexia. </p>
<p>Same sky, different motive. Louise stands beneath Lindbergh&rsquo;s monoplane. </p>
<p>She photographs the cockpit, the lens cap a hole in her palm, </p>
<p>her coat with its doveless sleeves. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got her on hold. Somewhere it&rsquo;s burning -- north </p>
<p>where the hills prop up an exclamation. The smell of paraffin, <br />the faint sound of a third voice, the handset's double helix. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This road's a ladleful of dark on mustard fields, </p>
<p>a gift of Brother Junipero, icon of devotion </p>
<p>to the next place, next thing. She finds a coffee shop </p>
<p>in Gilroy with its musk and old men's wattles </p>
<p>and a vacant lino top with two maps: one speaks </p>
<p> Monterey and one does not. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A tapping on the edge, the first few steps toward grace, </p>
<p>long bladed legs, scissoring the gray, making Mondrians.</p>
<p>Eyes mid-lake, where city soot surrounds a waving hand, verdigris </p>
<p>and age-spotted, the congenial end of branches reaching </p>
<p>through the ice and jelloed muck, socketed in cold Missouri. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The wake of her Camaro snaps the rapt attention each </p>
<p>of countless ravens paid to something just </p>
<p>beneath Ohio snow. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>She believes the Iowa elm is wider than she </p>
<p>is tall. And checks again, flat against the forest </p>
<p>floor. Lucy dreaming, drones dragging a queen </p>
<p> through her ear.</p>
