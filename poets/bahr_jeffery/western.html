<h1>Jeffery Bahr </h1>



<h1>Western Therapy</h1>
<p>When did this first begin to affect  you?</p>
<p>The Bering Strait froze over and  Mongolians<br />moved in and now we&rsquo;re making houses  from hay<br />and planting aspen and imagine a black  mountain<br />  of mesquite briquettes and buffalo in  freezers.</p>
<p>Did you always feel this way?</p>
<p>This is after that first line to the  horizon and the Platte still a victim<br />of indecision. Before the change in  the top twenty feet (not that<br />we decompose all that differently)  when the clouds didn&rsquo;t feel they  had to<br />  look like something, and these water  towers like watch stems.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;re using your time  wisely?</p>
<p>The West waits and is not so much new  as in thought: windbreaks<br />and the absence of passenger pigeons.  Contrails and grilling fish.<br />  We will divvy up water and live apart  from the Seven Sisters.</p>
<p>What do you want to accomplish?</p>
<p>This will be painted and that will  tend to memory. The stars will  wander off<br />disorganized. There will be plates and  hot spots. The West will be<br />  somewhere else, and we will too.</p>
<p>Where do you want to go with this?</p>
<p>They will think we were curious (our  gods will go with us). They will  assume<br />that we suffered (bones and their  belongings). They will say we  were  optimists<br />  and lived on the shores of the Inland  Sea.</p>
