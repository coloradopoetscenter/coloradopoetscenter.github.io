<p>When the  fruit of summer&rsquo;s ripeness<br />hangs heavy  on its stem<br />  climb high to  find yourself.</p>
<p>Trace the  rushing creek<br />through  somber forest shaggy with lichen<br />  to the clear  brown-eyed lake below the divide.</p>
<p>The alpine  meadows are turning russet now.<br />Yet the bell  flowers still ring out<br />their  lavender blue, and the sun&rsquo;s warmth<br />pleases the  plump marmot today<br />  on his rock  above the willow brake.</p>
<p>With each  foothold higher on the earth&rsquo;s back<br />you step out  of yourself<br />and out of  yourself again, unpacking<br />yourself like  a set of Russian dolls<br />or nested  Chinese boxes, until<br />with the last  step out of yourself<br />everything  else steps inside of you; <br />and you step  to the place that&rsquo;s firm<br />  even when  this moment powders and blows away. </p>
