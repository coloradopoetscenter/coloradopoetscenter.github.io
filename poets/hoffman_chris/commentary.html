<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Every page  of <strong><em><a href="http://www.windstormcreative.com/windstorm/23191.htm">Cairns</a></em></strong> conveys the sacral, as revealed by the indwelling spirit of deserts, glacial  fjords, kittiwakes, bald eagles, bears, and pine forests. In so doing, these  poems draw upon the integrative wisdom of mystics and Native Americans, as well  as the poet&rsquo;s&nbsp;own. Whether river running or canyoneering, his soul  aspires, like &ldquo;brother canyon wren and sister whip snake,&rdquo;--to awaken always to  the first day.&rdquo; &nbsp; <br />-- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=br_ss_hs/104-2706141-8738365?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dstripbooks%3Arelevance-above%26dispatch%3Dsearch%26results-process%3Dbin&amp;field-keywords=reg+saner&amp;Go.x=11&amp;Go.y=10">Reg  Saner</a>, author of <em>Climbing into the Roots</em>, <em>Essays on Air</em>, <em>Red  Letters</em>, <em>So This is the Map</em> and <em>The Four-Cornered Falcon</em>,  winner of the Colorado Book Award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;  &quot;How  did he ever get that much light into this small book?&nbsp; <em>Cairns</em> is  the kind of joy bears would want if they were human. Chris Hoffman does not  write about things, he writes <em>in</em> things. Dwelling comes first.&nbsp;  Poems happen afterwards. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;This is not a poet whose narcissism stands in the way of his song.&nbsp;  He is humbled by magic.&nbsp; For the sake of everything, he disappears.&nbsp;  That&rsquo;s why his poetry is trustworthy.&nbsp; As with the ancients, he dispenses  nectar freely because he doesn&rsquo;t know what else to do.&nbsp; This is his  message: the wilder we get, the gentler we become. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just  by eating such words, filaments of luminosity might sprout from your  skull.&nbsp; I recommend this book.&quot; <br />&mdash; Evan  Hodkins, Director of the <a href="http://www.schoolofalchemy.com/">School of  Alchemy </a> <br />&nbsp; <br />&quot;Like a  shaman or bard of old, his thoughts and imagery can evoke a myriad of life&rsquo;s  experiences in a few rich, moving lines. This book is a journey you will be  delighted to share.&quot; <br />&mdash; Francesca  Ciancimino Howell, author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590030087/qid=1138494587/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-2706141-8738365?s=books">Making  Magic with Gaia</a>: </em> <br /><em>&nbsp;Practices to Heal Ourselves and  Our Planet</em>. <br />&nbsp; <br />&quot;A  priest of desert and river, Chris Hoffman paints rich and satisfying imagery  with his reverent pen.&nbsp; For those who relish the timeless canyon-covered  landscape of the Southwest, this collection will be read with delight.&quot; <br />&mdash; Cass Adams,  editor of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0971078637/qid=1138494649/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-2706141-8738365?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">The  Soul Unearthed:</a> Celebrating Wildness and </em> <br /><em>Personal Renewal Through Nature</em><u> </u> <br />&nbsp; <br />&quot;Chris  Hoffman's poems capture both the spiritual essence and day-to-day nitty gritty  of life in the canyons.&quot;&nbsp; <br />&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rick Medrick, E.D., Executive Director <a href="http://www.olts-bt.com/">Outdoor  Leadership Training Seminars </a>and Breaking Through Adventures </p>
