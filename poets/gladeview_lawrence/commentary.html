  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>“I devoured over half the book in  the parking lot outside the post office. &nbsp;I pulled over three blocks  later, lit a cigarette and devoured the other half. &nbsp;I would like to have  a beer with Gladeview. &nbsp;He is a natural story-teller with an astute eye,  scathing wit, and a wicked sense of humor! &nbsp;The book features striking  cover art by award-winning photographer Eleanor Bennett. &nbsp;Absolutely  stunning in its content and creation – another winner from PigeonBike Press.  &nbsp;This isn’t a POD press, these books are built from ground zero, each book  you can feel the adventure by touch alone…” &nbsp;<br /> (Wolf  Carstens, Epic Rites Press)</p>  <p>“<em>Just Ignore The Beer Stains</em> is the work of a true barstool prophet.  &nbsp;Gladeview writes accessible, engaging poetry on the darkness and the  light of the everyday and the Everyman, dispensing shots of wit and more than a  few lingering chasers of wisdom.” &nbsp;<br /> (Chris  Yurkoski, Domesday Notebook)</p>  <p>“The poems hit harder than Mike  Tyson.” <br /> (John  Yamrus)</p>
