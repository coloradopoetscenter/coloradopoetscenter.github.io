<h1>On the Bank of the Nameless River
</h1>
<p>In the end, all rivers are  nameless,<br />just as currents folding back and  back<br />where water bends against the bank<br />are nameless, the water itself  different<br />and indifferent in that crook<br />of river, though ripples repeat  shape,<br />change ceaselessly. Chunks of  sandstone<br />lie nameless. Cottonwoods rising  on sand spits<br />splitting the water may have names<br />but ones I&rsquo;ll never know. A red  fox<br />hunting the riverbottom this May  morning<br />does not call her prey by name nor<br />name her pups, nourished on blood<br />milled in anonymous bones.<br />Spring&rsquo;s first crickets scratch<br />from tall grass on the bank a  descant<br />to the river&rsquo;s full-throated song<br />as wind throbs through willows<br />and sweeps down-valley, carrying  tales<br />off the fractured black peak, and  all of it<br />is nameless. What would I call  this place?<br />What voice could join these  harmonies<br />and last as long as water and  wind?<br />From now on, I will go nameless,<br />without fear of vanishing,<br />  listening for my feet upon earth.</p>
