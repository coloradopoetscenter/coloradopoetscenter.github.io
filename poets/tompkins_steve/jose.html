<h1>Jos&eacute; Jover Tripaldi, After the Death of Garc&iacute;a Lorca </h1>
<p>Even now, the  olive trees <br />point their  accusatory limbs at me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />  but I am not the  one who shot him. </p>
<p>I am the one who comforted him the night<br />
before he died, the one who brought him cigarettes <br />  and coffee, a copy of <em>El Granadino,</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the one who talked to him about poetry&mdash;<br />
the hidden beauty of G&oacute;ngora and <em>Los Soledades</em>, <br />  and when no one else would tell him </p>
<p>what was going to happen, I am the one<br />
who gave him the truth: I told him <br />  he would die in the morning. </p>
<p>I alone listened to him recite the prayer <br />
his mother taught him, the same prayer my mother<br />  taught me: <em>en  los brazos de Dios, no llorar&eacute;</em>,</p>
<p>and at dawn, I am  the one who walked him <br />to his grave, the  one who held his shaking hands&nbsp; <br />  when he gave his  final confession.</p>
<p>No, I am not the  one who shot him,&nbsp; <br />but the one who  asks forgiveness.&nbsp; <br />  Even now, the  olive trees . . .</p>
