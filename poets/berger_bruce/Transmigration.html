  <h1>Transmigration</h1>  <p>As  kerosene climbs through a wick,<br /> Or  sap through oak by the slow<br /> Fire  of transpiration,<br /> So  moisture from the saltpan<br /> Has  scaled the flesh and feathers<br /> Of  this long-fallen crow<br /> And  seededÂ  it with crystals.<br /> Alone  with its blue shadow<br /> As  if on a shield of snow,<br /> Half  scavenger with a tough beak,<br /> Now  more than half a vessel<br /> That  might have served Versailles,<br /> It  challenges the sun<br /> With  a blistering salt eye,<br /> Easy  in the wisdom<br /> That  its fellows are nothing at all,<br /> Serene  in its lucky fall,<br /> Its  dazzling transmigration<br /> From  bird to the stabler kingdom<br />  Of the gem and  mineral.</p>  <p>(first published in <em>Poetry</em>)</p>
