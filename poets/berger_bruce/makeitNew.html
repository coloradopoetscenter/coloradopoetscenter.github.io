  <h1>Make It New</h1>  <p>One century  after Frederick Jackson Turner<br /> Dismantled our  frontier, a balding man<br /> Across the  aisle on a coast-to-coast flight<br /> Pulled some  papers from his calfskin briefcase,<br /> Scanned them in  the laser of his seatlight,<br /> Ripped them in  half, then in quarters, and stuffed<br /> Them into a  plastic bag. When I returned<br /> To my magazine,  he promptly fetched some more,<br /> Held them to  the beam and calmly tore,<br /> Dismissing the  cart of drinks. Over the Catskills,<br /> Lake Erie, the  Mississippi, steadily<br /> Westering, he  shed a fine thin scrawl<br /> That documented,  I decided, life<br /> Up to here,  arid jobs and botched relations,<br /> Marriages and  most of all the kids<br /> Who dropped him  first and whom he now dismembered<br /> And crammed  into the plastic oubliette<br /> He would let  fall forever into the first<br /> Receptacle on  deplaning. Setting back<br /> His watch and  striding toward ground transportation<br /> With a  lightened carry-on, he would assume<br /> More  challenging positions, unentangling<br /> Alliances and  roads not previously<br /> Taken,  meanwhile pledging to resist<br /> Atlantic urges  to turn present joys<br /> Into the  tonnage of the written past<br /> Except,  perhaps, to let some foster self<br /> Dash off,  quixotically, the truly new<br /> On onionskin in  calligraphic haiku<br /> To slip between  the dense and still inflating<br />  Volumes of our  other coastal shelf.</p>  <p>(first  published in <em>The Hudson Review</em>)</p>
