  <h1>Money: A Primer</h1>  <p>Money, children, was invented to  symbolize<br /> Precise amounts of bread.<br /> Instead of hauling jars of grain  from here to there<br />  We transferred clam shells  instead.</p>  <p>Staples were set at exact sums of  money.<br /> A cow was five coins with the head  of the prince.<br /> A canoe was one crisp watermarked  Isis.<br /> No one has understood it since.</p>  <p>From the first, money spoke only<br /> To other money. For instance, no  Frenchman<br /> Ever communicated with the franc<br /> The way francs speak to marks with  perfect comprehension.</p>  <p>But money only pretended to be  jars of grain.<br /> Money was time, scarcity, the  capitalist yoke,<br /> Security, ruin or evidence of  salvation,<br /> Depending on who spoke.</p>  <p>Money is our common global  language,<br /> As current as currency,<br /> Yet decoding efforts have proved  it less tractable<br /> Than tree rings or Linear B.</p>  <p>Degrees are conferred, chairs  awarded, prizes delivered<br /> In Stockholm to those who have  shown<br /> That the eerily incestuous system  of money<br /> Should be managed or left alone.</p>  <p>The aforementioned have yet to  explain how money<br /> Springs from its own symbolic  loins.<br /> Words have never come up with  words the way<br /> Coins coin coins.</p>  <p>Freed from the drudgery of mere  barter, money<br /> Has pursued an intricate course<br /> Through consortiums, cartels and  multinationals<br /> With the opacity of a natural  force.</p>  <p>Money is a crude obsession with  things,<br /> Claims the anti-materialist  schism.<br /> This, at least, can be flatly  declared wrong.<br /> Money is mysticism.</p>  <p>(first published in <em>Barronâ€™s</em>, included in <em>Facing the Music</em>) </p>
