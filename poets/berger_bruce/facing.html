          <h1>Facing the Music</h1>
          <p>Season by season the listener sits<br />
            In the fifteenth row and just to  the left<br />
            Where frowns, bowing, fingerings,  the conductor’s<br />
            Downbeats, nods and attenuated  slurs<br />
            Slip easily into the eye,<br />
            Where above all<br />
            The acoustics of the refurbished  downtown hall<br />
            Bring hearing, heartbeat and a  bi-monthly program<br />
          Into one consonance.</p>
          <p>When did the prodigy mature, when<br />
            Did the virtuoso lose his edge?<br />
            Nights in focus blurred from year  to year.<br />
            Sadly easier to pin down<br />
            The concertmaster’s new beard, a  cellists’s chair<br />
            Rigged for a back problem, a huge  bassoonist<br />
            Replaced by kid with moustache,  the harpist’s hair<br />
            Gone natural. Dizzyingly, the  strings<br />
            Getting younger and younger. The  influx<br />
            Of women, Latins, Asians, the  first blacks,<br />
            The orchestra becoming the crowd  in the street. </p>
          <p>Change certified within the civic  shell!<br />
            One guest conductor all theater  and sweat,<br />
            Next month a mannikin. Still worse<br />
            The flawed appointment,  perfectionist martinet<br />
            Endured a half-decade. Truly grave<br />
            The year of the strike, the season  nearly canceled.<br />
            Musicians and flight attendants or  firemen?<br />
            Music as service or product? The  listener gave<br />
            And gave again.</p>
          <p>Time changed itself so differently  each time.<br />
            The baroque chug, the  impressionist swoon,<br />
            The yearly cold dip<br />
            Into twelve tone, the classical  shrine’s<br />
            Overblown façade. And somewhere in  every line-up<br />
            A deeply involving theme<br />
            Withstood its trial by ravishment  to return<br />
            In such pure celebration it was  time <br />
            Itself, two nights in thirty, that  swam upstream,<br />
            Branched, unfolded, spawned,  evolved,<br />
            Renewed itself in a universe  running down.</p>
          <p>Outsitting three conductors, five  concertmasters,<br />
            An orchestra replenishing itself<br />
            Like a body changing cells, the  listener,<br />
            Clutching at last a younger elbow<br />
            To reach, just to the left, the  fifteenth row,<br />
            Besieges time that blurs from year  to year,<br />
            Until the inevitable night<br />
            No player, under the stage lights’  glare,<br />
            Senses the absent hearing,  heartbeat and sight<br />
            That filled a particular chair.<br />
            The baton rises for the next  listener there.</p>
