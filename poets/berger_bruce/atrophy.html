  <h1>Atrophy Homes</h1>  <p>Stags from the foundry bugle the  front door.<br /> Drifts of shingle veined with  chromium drainpipe<br /> Part for the heaven-storming  atrium where<br /> Bolts from a cirro-stratus  chandelier<br /> On a timer stoke the drama of a  staircase<br /> That gyres around a ficus someone  dusts.<br /> Failing daylight cues the copper  coachlights.<br /> Well-sculpted if unlettered gapes  the mailbox.<br /> Come Christmas, braced for with a  spangled spruce,<br /> The demigods descend, luscious in  fur,<br /> Spilling gifts for caterers, the  au pair,<br /> The startled mailman. Corks and  snowballs soar, <br /> Ski boots splash the pantry,  lights are switched<br /> By rosy flesh, garage doors rise  and fall,<br /> The structure blazes like a desert  casino.<br /> Before the demigods touch back  once more<br /> Come summer, mowers call and  edgers keen,<br /> Glads already blossoming take  root,<br /> Rackets and clubs deplane,  skateboards leap,<br /> Security can relax. And here and  there,<br /> Whelmed amid the dormered  embassies,<br /> The spec palazzi and half-timbered  keeps,<br /> Heirs of the mullioned, dark,  eleven-room <br /> Pinched originals that set this  pace<br /> Way back, finding their robber  baronage<br /> Jet-setted, jettisoned and plain  displaced<br /> By its own theme, can hear their  deadliest<br /> Epithets -- <em>Conspicuous Nonconsumption,</em><br /><em>Insider Trader Vernacular, Geek Revival </em>--<br /> Die among poodled shrubs as if among<br /> Aisles of an unpopular museum,<br /> Its rotely dusted racks of  inscribed cups,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its bodiless  pronghorn gazing with glass eyes.</p>  <p>(published in <em>The Geography of Hope: Poets ofColoradoâ€™s Western Slope</em>)</p>
