<h1><strong> </strong>DEER DANCE TAOS PUEBLO</h1>  <p>A  Pueblo woman stretches her hand<br /> from  the circle to skins draped <br /> on  dancers as they pass by, her <br /> gnarled  fingers stroking wet musky <br /> fur  of fresh antelope and deer.<br /> Each  time she reaches past my shoulder <br /> I  feel my grandmother&rsquo;s swollen fingers <br /> in  my waist-length hair, twisting <br /> it  high on my head in summer, <br /> sunburned  ends red against <br /> winter  black strands, or when <br /> sun  dipped to the bay's horizon, <br /> Ordelia  at the dining room window <br /> starching  white blouses till cotton <br /> scratched  like sand of July beaches.  <br /> It's  the movement of her hands braided <br /> with  the rhythm of this Christmas day,<br /> the  dance of old hands as they reach <br /> into  dark hair and fresh skin.</p>  <p>Appeared in <em>Caprice </em><br /> and the anthology <em>They Recommend This Place</em></p>
