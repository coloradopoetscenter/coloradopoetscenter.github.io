        <h1><strong> </strong>DEER DANCE TAOS PUEBLO</h1>
          <p>A  Pueblo woman stretches her hand<br />
            from  the circle to skins draped <br />
            on  dancers as they pass by, her <br />
            gnarled  fingers stroking wet musky <br />
            fur  of fresh antelope and deer.<br />
            Each  time she reaches past my shoulder <br />
            I  feel my grandmother&rsquo;s swollen fingers <br />
            in  my waist-length hair, twisting <br />
            it  high on my head in summer, <br />
            sunburned  ends red against <br />
            winter  black strands, or when <br />
            sun  dipped to the bay's horizon, <br />
            Ordelia  at the dining room window <br />
            starching  white blouses till cotton <br />
            scratched  like sand of July beaches.  <br />
            It's  the movement of her hands braided <br />
            with  the rhythm of this Christmas day,<br />
            the  dance of old hands as they reach <br />
            into  dark hair and fresh skin.</p>
          <p>            Appeared in <em>Caprice </em><br />
            and the anthology <em>They Recommend This Place</em></p>
