          <h1>HOUSE AT OTOWI BRIDGE</h1>
          <p>Wooden bridge suspended between <br />
cement abutments has survived,  while<br />
the adobe restaurant run by a  woman <br />
with help of a San Ildefonso man  has not, <br />
where Oppenheimer would come to  talk, <br />
away from what was going on up  the hill.  </p>
          <p>If conversations ever crossed  the boundary <br />
            between a woman alone in the  desert <br />
            and a man's obligation to  government, <br />
            it was she who could see, each  day <br />
            from where she sat, the  interweave <br />
            of twisted steel supporting  planks that <br />
            brought him to her door in a  blinding sun.  </p>
          <p>Oppenheimer followed through  even with <br />
            doubts, and she day by day  accepted more<br />
            help from the one who had always  lived <br />
            on a dark and turmoiled river.</p>
          <p>The restaurant's gone, torn down  when<br />
            they put in a new highway to Los  Alamos,<br />
            no longer any reason to be  remote, unknown. <br />
            From the new bridge, I spy two  wooden <br />
            crosses inside a crumbling roof  and wall.<br />
            Not the graves of two who ran a  restaurant<br />
            in this unlikely place, but a  monument that<br />
            transcends time and space.</p>
