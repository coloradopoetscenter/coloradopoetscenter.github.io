  <h1>YOU WILL FIND NO IMPURITY</h1>  <p><em>Weigh my heart, summon me by night,</em><br /> <em>  melt me  down; you will find no impurity in me.</em><br /> <em>—Psalm  17</em></p>  <p>It is not myself that I speak of,<br /> but the land which I traverse,<br /> the land which I inhabit.<br /> I have lived in extremes. <br /> And, if there is one criticism of me<br /> that may be valid, down so deep, <br /> as to be inseparable from soul, <br /> it is that I am a risk taker.<br /> I lack timidity, reticence,<br /> as the bay I lived on lacked control<br /> over the moon that shifted tides from <br /> bulkhead to the edge of fifth sandbar.<br /> It may have been more than five,<br /> but more seems not to matter when there<br /> is the muck between the risen land <br /> under a sea to traverse, such that the act <br /> of Moses required no imagination as a child: <br /> we witnessed it twice a day.<br /> Or the desert cliffs I have walked for years,<br /> not surprised that they contain the remains<br /> of a sea, but that the fascination continues,<br /> such that when I saw a painting on a wall <br /> of a gallery last spring, larger than what <br /> the remaining uncovered walls where I reside <br /> can hold, I not only remember the answer, <br /> but the intricate details of the telling:<br /> a nautilus, a chamber, which was found inside <br /> a baculite, for which the mesa east is named, <br /> which when the artist asked about the color <br /> best to paint, the answer was red, because in <br /> the land of Sangre de Cristos we have become <br /> accustomed to red. The artist, instead, <br /> chose the other side of the color spectrum: <br /> she chose blue. </p>  <p>Appeared  in <em>Contrarywise: An Anthology</em> and the chapbook <em>Going into Exile</em></p>
