          <h1>WASP BUZZING AND WATER SHEDDING, JIMMY GROWING WET </h1>
          <p>On their porch, where Jimmy and his dad they    sometimes sit and watch the sun go down, watch the night come on, there are    pockets of open space like shallow pools, and Jimmy, sometimes it is his job    to get out the hose and put his thumb on the end and force the wasps' nests    from those places.&nbsp; <br />
            <br />
            Jimmy has a storage of bees in his stomach, and they re-tune his whole body    as he goes, walks, looking for his mother who has entirely gone and will    never come back. Jimmy's mother, split in half by a train, disintegrating,    alcohol flames sparking through her momentarily, eating away the grey in her    lungs.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
            Sitting, watching the sun turn into the moon, a pale and quick time when his    dad, Jimmy's father, he is not searching the drips of faucet water for the    face of his wife, for Jimmy's mother, for a world that can be put back    together, reshaped into a livable season. <br />
  <br />
            The wasps, they nest in this porch, their porch, because these are places out    of the sun and the wind and the rain and high enough that kids with sticks,    like friends, if Jimmy had friends, if the friends that Jimmy doesn't have    were to treat the porch like a pi√±ata, those sticks wouldn't reach this kind    of nest that these wasps have built.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
            Jimmy, his hands hold the hose. The water, rushing out, it is a beacon,    galloping in his head.<br />
  <br />
            The nests, the homes of wasps, they are made of paper. And Jimmy, he would    like nothing more than to take down those nests, carefully with his hands,    feeling the sting and wiping the wasps away, brushing their wings with his    knuckles, and unfolding that paper and reading the words written there. Your    mother is coming back it would say, when Jimmy he stretched it open. Of if    Jimmy found the inside of this nest and there were no words written, there    was no message and no lines, he would take out a pencil, one from the cup on    his desk&nbsp; in his bedroom in this town, and Jimmy, he would write a love    letter to himself on the inside. And Jimmy, he would wad it back together and    stick it again to the holes in their porch, in their hearts, waiting for the    new arrival of more wasps.<br />
  <br />
            The water washes the bees, tugs their wings into puddles.<br />
  <br />
            Jimmy and his father at night, one night, watching the sun go into its summer    hills, the moon mirroring back, the locust noises.<br />
  <br />
            Dissidence is what Jimmy hears. Dissonance is what Jimmy hears, his mother    stroking the hair from his forehead, no words issuing from her lips, those    lips, a perfect nest for him to paper down in. <br />
