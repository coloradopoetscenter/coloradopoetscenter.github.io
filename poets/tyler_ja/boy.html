  <h1>BOY [N1]</h1>  <p>Boy  in his house is Boy with shoes untied is Boy with balloon fists is Boy with  dimples is Boy without irony is Boy with movies playing in each eye, one and  another, is Boy as seasons and mostly fall is Boy and what is compacted when  coal crushes into diamonds and diamonds are made into clouds and clouds are  coming down all full of rain. </p>  <p>The  machine gun sputters into a church crowd. The machine gun clamors in this  neighborhood. The machine gun cuts into lines of sage bushes and all the people  huddled about them, wearing dust in their hair, dirty knees and look at these  and all of them holy and holey and saying through open o mouths this is o so o  o o.</p>  <p>EVERYTHING  WILL BE EXPLAINED.</p>  <p>A  billboard with a clean smile. A billboard with white teeth. A billboard with  swimming rags of persons underneath its rims its poles its lights pissing on  its rails and huddling in its light and kicking dirt to dirt in the shadow it  casts when the days they go to one hundred two hundred three hundred and all  the people their lungs cave in and mutate, turning them inside out.<br /> Boy  in this cave of a new world is Boy in darkness is the same as Boy in burning  white is the same as Boy when he used to smile because now he is only looking  for trinkets on this the spalltered ground and finding everything crushed  everything splintered everything broken everything sweated down to the bottom  of its possibilities. </p>  <p>THIS  IS O SO O O O.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The  world makes a sound:</p>  <p>ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.</p>  <p>Open-ended  lines that used to hold kites that used to hold children's hands that used to  hold fathers' hands that used to hold mothers' hands that used to hold the  railing going down into the lion's den at the zoo or into the planetarium at  the museum or into the parent-teacher conferences or the back-to-school night  when they would talk about A B C D F and are now the lines that remain  open-ended and do not connect and float skyward touching clouds holding clouds  grasping clouds pinned to clouds and with no way anyone knows to let them go.</p>  <p>Wind  says the word GO. Sun says the words STAY and DON'T and SURE and MAYBE and Boy  he is conflicted he is thirsty he is lonely he is lost he is tired he is ragged  he is damaged he is spilling he is spent he is soured he is soggy he is  &nbsp;longing. </p>  <p>GO  STAY DON'T SURE MAYBE.<br /> SURE  MAYBE STAY DON'T GO.<br /> DON'T  GO MAYBE STAY SURE.<br /> SURE  STAY MAYBE DON'T GO.<br /> DON'T  STAY SURE MAYBE GO.<br /> GO  MAYBE SURE DON'T STAY.</p>  <p>Boy  in a field is Boy with wind is Boy with sun is Boy with arms is Boy with legs  is Boy buried in thoughts of aborted children and cities laid down and resting  as a means to death and death as a means to resting and Boy is fixed and Boy  becomes still and Boy in a field like this field with all the oceans and all  the bodies and all the unmoving moments is Boy made of anti-solidity is Boy of  doubled-force is Boy of casting no shadow is Boy of breakage. </p>  <p>Corn  made to fuel Corn made to meal Corn made to ground dust and mixed with water  and flattened and roasted over a low fire built on rocks built on dry ground  built away from unbillowed trees built underneath an orange sky a red sky a  purple sky a softened sky a sky that will seep until it melts and will melt  until it droops and will droop until it covers Boy and his blanket in another  blanket that is sky colored and sky scented and sky flavored and sky like  reverting to sucking thumbs.</p>  <p>Feet  on the ground make a noise that is this:</p>  <p>gggkkgkgkggggggggkgkgkgkgk</p>  <p>or  is this:</p>  <p>sssssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhh</p>  <p>or  is this:</p>  <p>hahahahahahahahahahahahaha</p>  <p>Feet  on the ground make these words:</p>  <p>DRIP  DROP DRIP DROP DRIP DROP.</p>  <p>A  cross in a front yard burned a cross in a front yard smashed a cross in a front  yard with a man on it who has been crucified who is crucified who is acting the  part of crucifixion to ward off spirits that are not here to get rid of vibes  that have gone quiet already to make a change in a landscape that is now  forever changing and the cross then is a hat rack and he is not crucified but  is instead a hat on the hat rack with his chin bowed down and no one seeing how  his eyes look when they look down at the ground from nailed up on his cross. </p>  <p>His  lips this man they make a noise when his lights go out and it resonates:</p>  <p>ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ</p>  <p>Boy  watching&nbsp; man die is Boy becoming a man is Boy acting like a girl is Boy  wanted to be a girl is Boy wanting to be Mother Mary is Boy wanting to move is  Boy wanting to die is Boy wanted to know if dying is sleeping is Boy wanting to  know if sleeping takes too long is it dying.</p>  <p>COME  ON OVER he hears and Boy doesn't move.</p>  <p>COME  ON COME ON COME ON OVER.</p>  <p>Boy  is Boy watching.</p>  <p>WE  CAN IMPROVE.</p>  <p>Land  is scorched and land is bruised and land is learned and land is unsettled and  land is shifting and land is cruising and land is coming undone and land is  morphing and land is transforming and land is adjusting.<br /> Boy  who is all of these things. </p>  <p>(http://thediagram.com/10_3/tyler.html)</p>
