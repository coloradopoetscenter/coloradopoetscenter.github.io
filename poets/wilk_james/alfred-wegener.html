<h1>Alfred Wegener Speaks to His Wife</h1>
<p>Laurasia has divorced Gondwanaland.<br />Enormous inland seas and vast primeval<br />rainforests turn to desert through  upheaval<br />of continents, which group and then  disband.<br />Great rock formations crumble into  sand.<br />In consequence, the climate turns  uncivil<br />and ecosystems vanish. Neither evil<br />nor good, tectonic plates break up,  unplanned.<br />&nbsp;<br />If something sturdy as a continent<br />is ripped apart by earthquakes and  subduction,<br />crust melting into magma, rocks  entombed<br />in Hell, then we of thin integument,<br />who bear our own upheavals and  corruption,<br />will drift apart as well. All love is  doomed.<br />&nbsp;<br />  (First appeared in <em>Measure</em>, Volume II, 2007)  &nbsp;</p>
