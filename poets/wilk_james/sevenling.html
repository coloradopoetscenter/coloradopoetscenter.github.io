<h1>Sevenling (He Is Doctor)</h1>
<p>&nbsp;He is doctor to a thousand<br />girls, husband to a woman<br />and father to a boy.<br />&nbsp;<br />The girls complain of their  discharges,<br />the woman about his hours spent on  them<br />and he about the cost of it all.<br />&nbsp;<br />  The boy alone doesn't complain.</p>
