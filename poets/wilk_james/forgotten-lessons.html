  <h1>Forgotten Lessons</h1>  <p>When I still could climb<br /> the trees in my mother’s yard<br /> I matriculated to CU med.<br /> And like a new mother<br /> stocking a diaper bag <br /> for every contingency,<br /> I stuffed my temporal lobes<br /> with the<em> logia</em> of body—<br /> anatomy, physiology<br /> pharmacology, pathology—<br /> until somewhere between<br /> abacavir and zygoma,<br /> I forgot the sweet sweat of apple<br />  blossoms on my fingers. </p>  <p>(First appeared  in <em>The Oak Bend Review</em>) </p>
