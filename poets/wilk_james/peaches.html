<h1>Peaches</h1>
<p>&nbsp;What was I thinking?--when in the  awkwardness<br />of youth, I dropped a peach stone and  it rolled<br />under a fence in San Luis, beyond my  reach--<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Did I imagine it would take root in  spite<br />
of the gravel and rain-soaked  newspapers<br />
or that it might be carried off by a  songbird?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
No, it was forgotten in other  thoughts:<br />
of oranges and apples and later,  bananas,<br />
freckled and aromatic ripening  bunches.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But now chance finds me at the  farmers&acirc;&euro;&trade; market,<br />
a wrinkled hand carefully cupping<br />
a Colorado peach so as not to bruise  it,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
fingers embracing its velvet to  prevent it<br />
from rolling down to the gravel below,<br />
and think again of that abandoned  peach stone--<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That had I the courage to hop the  fence and retrieve it,<br />
perhaps, and planted it in my own  garden,<br />
tending it, nurturing it--<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The tree would be fully mature by now;<br />
in springtime hung with bloom along  every bough<br />
and in late summer bearing our dimpled  fruit.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
