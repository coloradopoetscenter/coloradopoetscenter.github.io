  <h1>Three Nights with Crow</h1>  <p>To climb through layered<br /> dreams and lift the last<br /> tissue of waking, to</p>  <p>find soot on the pillow,<br /> prints splayed and wet.<br /> For three nights there </p>  <p>are nameless children in<br /> cribs, faceless people I’ve<br /> forgotten to feed and</p>  <p>coddle. When the nursery<br /> door opens, they move<br /> into the next room</p>  <p>through walls, like ghosts.<br /> I’ve given names to <br /> even earrings and the</p>  <p>tags around the dog’s<br /> neck—names like<br /><em>sweet ones</em>, and</p>  <p><em>low-jingles</em>—now <br /> when it matters, there<br /> are only crossword</p>  <p>puzzles with boxes<br /> half-filled, the forgotten<br /> syllable, the blind</p>  <p>hope of touch. He <br /> dips his beaked face<br /> over mine, eyes widely</p>  <p>spaced, sore from flying<br /> into the sun—grips the<br /> off-green egg with</p>  <p>care—lays it<br /> within the slippery-walled<br /> nest among wood</p>  <p>shavings, kapok and<br /> horse hair for its<br /> eighteen-day gestation.</p>  <p>Deeper still, to the<br /> place truths unrobe,<br /> where children</p>  <p>wear avian heads<br /> (feathers bristled along<br /> their spines), where</p>  <p>he removes human <br /> offspring, arcs overhead,<br /> returns for the mother.</p>  <p>(Previously  published in <em>The Burden of Wings)</em></p>
