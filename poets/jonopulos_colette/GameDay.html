  <h1>Game Day</h1>  <p>Eliminate all dangerous objects, small items and sharp ones. Take away  food that might choke. Put the knives up high, all glass out of reach. And then  he grabs the grill just minutes after you arrive for the BBQ. The ER Dr. stares  at your failure, two large blisters, one across the palm of his small hand.  What was only deep red has ballooned into something his mother will use to keep  him from you. You know this, and all you want is to comfort him, make him  laugh, and for a moment the bright white of bandages behind glass doors catches  his attention. The plasma television in triage room 2 blasts the local football  game. As you cradle your crying son, people stop to watch the game playing  above your heads. Oregon goes ahead of Stanford, and the ER staff grins, as if  your pain is secondary. And it is; you are secondary to all of his falls, his  bruises, that first broken bone. You imagine him with shoulder pads and helmet,  his mother on the opposite side of the bleacher. On the way home, police winnow  traffic into one lane, so the fans can slowly filter from the stadium. How  simple, you think, to watch a game, to wear yellow and green, to go home.  Instead you head for Wal-Mart to pick up antibiotic cream and bandages, wishing  this night would end, and you could awaken to the boy clapping his two hands  together. Instead he crawls with a sock over his bandages, one elbow to the  ground; and you want to explain it to him, how you looked away just for a  second, how his mother might have done the same, how even though your breath is  caught somewhere in your ribcage, you can take the hit and still carry him into  the end zone.</p>  <p>(Previously  published in <em>Bellingham Review</em>)</p>
