  <h1>Third Place</h1>  <p>I’m gathering  evidence of hope<br /> news taken from  the paper<br /> people are eating  again<br /> in Darfur or  eating a little<br /> or some of the  people are<br /> eating a little</p>  <p>I want to get  this right so I<br /> reread the news  fourth page<br /> second column<br /> the noise of too  many morning voices<br /> reverberating off  the ceiling<br /> I observe people  in conversation<br /> we’ve all  stumbled<br /> into famine of a  different kind</p>  <p>logos cover every  surface<br /> opulence for the  common man<br /> I like it here<br /> the feel of it<br /> when I walk  through the door<br /> the girl knows my  drink<br /> extra-hot latte  with caramel drizzled on top</p>  <p>I cannot turn  away from excess<br /> from the cup  steaming my glasses<br /> from the measured  geography of hope<br /> from the next  paragraph<br /> people in  hard-backed chairs<br /> leaving scones  broken<br /> on too many<br /> pristine plates</p>  <p>(Originally published in <em>Alimentum</em>)</p>
