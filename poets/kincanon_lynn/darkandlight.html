  <h1>The Dark and the  Light</h1>  <p>My  fourteen year old cat is curled <br /> on  the papers on my desk,<br /> the  western light streaming through<br /> warming  her thinning frame.<br /> I  have loved and lost<br /> so  many times that I ask<br /> what  it means to bond with those<br /> whose  lives or time with me<br /> are  short lived and awash in grief at the end?<br /> I  know now the dark and the light sides<br /> to  loving are always there waiting<br /> and  that having love like this<br /> and  felt its absence, I will surely invite<br />  it  into my life again, and again.<br />  Isn&rsquo;t  that living?  Isn&rsquo;t that why I&rsquo;m alive?</p>  <p>Published in Self Published Chap Book of Art and  Poetry, with a grant endowed from Art Space, In the Meantime Gallery and  NEA:  <em>Art  as Metaphor, Analogy and Allegory</em>, 2013.</p>
