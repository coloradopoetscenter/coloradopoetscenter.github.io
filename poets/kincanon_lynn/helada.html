          <h1>Helada Blanca  (Hoar Frost)</h1>
          <p>Lace  draped branches, water, skin<br />
            are  woven together, fragile, brittle, cold.<br />
            Into  the woods deeply, hoar frost blurs the difference<br />
            between  everything alive and everything dead.<br />
            The  path here is buried under days of snow.<br />
            It  is easy to get lost, the fog erases the familiar.<br />
            You  must experience this alone, the silence <br />
            of  white on white crystalline whiteness.<br />
            I  lose my mind staring at a single tree.<br />
            For  the brief time, magic exists.<br />
          How  does one stop the unraveling?</p>
