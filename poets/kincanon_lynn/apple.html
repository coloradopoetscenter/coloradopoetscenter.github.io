          <h1>Apple Blossom Time</h1>
          <p>When I look  back at the men in my life<br />
            some of the  decisions I have made <br />
            haunt me.<br />
            I used to  take more time <br />
            selecting an  apple off the shelf<br />
            examining  its texture, color of skin and fragrance.<br />
            Gala,  Jonathan, Roma all promising <br />
            Familiarity,  consistency, permanence.<br />
            I swear if I  could, I would have sunk my teeth into them all,<br />
            assuring  that their crispness<br />
            paired with  an exquisite hint of sweetness<br />
            was finished  with the requisite tint of tartness.<br />
            I remain  hindered by those years.<br />
            The choices  I may still make <br />
          taunt me.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, if  I imagined them as edible dates<br />
            I would know  how to choose them!<br />
            I would  first ask myself:  Am I too hungry?<br />
            Are they  ripe?  Have they turned?   <br />
            Do they have  the necessary nutrients?<br />
            Are they  possibly poisonous or even mildly injurious?<br />
            Are the pits  too large, should they be spurned?<br />
            For desired  qualities I would search the hemispheres:<br />
            Sweet with a  nice shape, supple; yet resilient. <br />
            And of course,  they must be very very rich–<br />
            in flavor.<br />
            I would also  inquire how they remained this way<br />
            after all  these years <br />
            without  being  cynical, critical<br />
            or terribly  satirical.</p>
          <p>Plucked  fresh from the date palm on this sultry afternoon<br />
            I would wipe  the dew from his soft sun- drenched skin<br />
            and savor  him, long before I start to swoon!<br />
            This long  winter will be over soon.<br />
            With wing  repaired<br />
            the possible  paths of my life<br />
            tempt me. <br />
            As a bee in  apple blossom time.</p>
