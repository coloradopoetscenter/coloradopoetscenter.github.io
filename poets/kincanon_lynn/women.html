          <h1>Women Who Run With  Wolves</h1>
          <p>Women  who run with wolves are unlike<br />
            the  woman who meditates with foxes<br />
            transcending&nbsp;  the longing,  hunger and fears.<br />
            Together  we&nbsp;turn our backs to the mountains<br />
            and&nbsp;the  beast inside&nbsp;subsides.<br />
            We  spend our days in the garden<br />
            where  fruit is abundant and nakedness openly resides.<br />
            And  then come the coyotes playing, laughing, procreating.<br />
            Their  cries disappearing and reappearing over the ridgeline.<br />
            Foxes  and coyotes have evolved to survive here with me,<br />
            but  the wolves…., well, they do not come out of the mountains.<br />
            You  have to go in after them.  If I did that<br />
          I  am not sure I would make it back.</p>
