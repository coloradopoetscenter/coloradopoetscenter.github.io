<h1 >Reading Availability</h1>  <p>I am available at any  opportunity to share my poetry at public readings.  I would welcome the opportunity to work with  students to engage them in the exercise of writing and help them to be better  at the spoken and written word.  I am  able at times to make this a collaborative effort by bringing artists and  writers and musicians to accompany me.  </p>  <p>Lynn Kincanon<br />  <a href="mailto:lkincanon@comcast.net">lkincanon@comcast.net</a></p>  <p> 970.412.0259</p>
