<h1>Biography</h1>  <p>I have a masters of Science  in Nursing and my profession is as a Nurse Practitioner in the field of cardiac  surgery.  I have been writing poetry for  as long as I can remember, delving seriously into the work of it in the past ten  years.  I minored in English, and have  been continuing my education by studying the work of others, attending many workshops  and classes.  I have  worked with tutors to learn the art of reading  my poetry aloud.I have become enmeshed  in the world of the written and spoken word in Loveland, Colorado. <br />  In 2011 I started the <em>Artists&rsquo; Collective</em> in Loveland Colorado, and began my foray into  collaborative work with area poets, artists and musicians to perform and build  installations that include my poetic works.  </p>
