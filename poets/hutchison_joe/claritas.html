<h1>Claritas</h1>
<p> An acrid slurry creeps into the soil inside the hog farm. It soaks downward and outward, under fences, into the rain-fattened streams. From there: the rivers. . . . </p>
<p class="indent"> Ten miles away, a boy comes home from a swim in the lake and winces drinking his milk. The first of many cankers opens its cigarette-burn between tongue and cheek. </p>
<p class="indent"> We keep living longer, but our food lacks flavor. Our hearts flop in our chests like deformed frogs. </p>
<p class="indent">The President dies but continues in office. </p>
<p class="indent"> Forgetting dreams is now habitual. </p>
<p class="indent">We&rsquo;ve taken to wearing glasses that automatically darken, just to endure the sting of <em>claritas. </em></p>
<p class="indent"> The ozone layer thins. Days intensify. Winters strike a compromise with summers. And an acrid brightness creeps through the skin, enters the bloodstream. From there: the heart. . . . </p>
<p class="indent"><em>Claritas!</em> Your bitter truths assault us wherever we turn. </p>
