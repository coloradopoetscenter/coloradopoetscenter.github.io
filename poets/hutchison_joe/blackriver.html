<h1> Black River </h1>
<p> You believe you must be beginning again.<br />The river opens to accept your first step,<br />and you&rsquo;re into it up to your knees&mdash;<br />the water&rsquo;s wrestle brotherly, bracing.<br />You start across, shouldering goods<br />you believe you&rsquo;ll need on the far side.<br />Waist-deep now. Feeling for rooted stones<br />through sopping boots. Surely this is where<br />you crossed before; there are no unknown<br />channels, no abysses, though the current<br />does seem swifter than you remember,<br />and darker (of course, it&rsquo;s only dusk<br />coming on, staining the air and water;<br />and the river&mdash;you believe&mdash;only seems<br />to be growing wider). Chest-deep now.<br />Icy water races past your racing heart,<br />under raised arms that ache to balance<br />whatever you carry, what you must (you<br />suddenly understand) be willing to let go.<br />Chin-deep. Perched on a slippery stone<br />that shifts with each shivering breath.<br />No choice but to take the next step&mdash;<br />deeper into the black river, farther<br />toward the shore of ink-black pines<br />over which the feverish stars have risen<br />and the cold comfort of a bone-white moon. </p>
