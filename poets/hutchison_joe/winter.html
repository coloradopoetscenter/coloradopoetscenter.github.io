<h1> Winter Sunrise Outside a Caf&eacute; Near Butte, Montana </h1>
<p> A crazed sizzle of blazing bees<br />
in the word EAT. Beyond it,<br />
<br />
thousands of stars have faded<br />
like deserted flowers in the thin<br />
<br />
light washing up in the distance,<br />
flooding the snowy mountains<br />
<br />
bluff by bluff. Moments later,<br />
the sign blinks, winks dark,<br />
<br />
and a white-aproned cook&mdash;<br />
surfacing in the murky sheen<br />
<br />
of the window&mdash;leans awhile<br />
like a cut lily . . . staring out<br />
<br />
into the famished blankness<br />
he knows he must go home to. </p>
