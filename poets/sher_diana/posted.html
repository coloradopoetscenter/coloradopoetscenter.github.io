          <h1>When All The Parts Were Posted</h1>
          <p>In his senior year<br />
            When all the parts were posted<br />
            We celebrated.<br />
            My son<br />
            Got the lead <br />
            Tevye, a fiddler<br />
            Balancing between college applications<br />
          And tradition.</p>
          <p>And me<br />
            Trying out <br />
            For <br />
            Letting go<br />
            A stumbling second-rate amateur<br />
            Beseeching<br />
            Do you love me?</p>
          <p>Aren’t we always rehearsing to leave Anatevka?          </p>
