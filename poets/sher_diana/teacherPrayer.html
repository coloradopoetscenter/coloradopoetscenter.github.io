  <h1>A Teacher’s Prayer</h1>  <p>Everyday<br /> I will tap your arm<br /> Looking for a vein<br /> If I find one<br /> We will share blood<br /> Transfuse ourselves<br /> Transcend ourselves<br /> Transform ourselves<br /> In the sacred temple<br /> Of the classroom<br /> The light will be so bright<br /> Our vision so clear<br /> I will see you <br /> Like you have never been seen<br /> And we will bring forth <br /> Knowledge <br />  From the earth. </p>  <p><em>Poetry Depth Quarterly</em></p>
