  <h1>Critical Commentary </h1>  <p>&ldquo;In small bright lines Sher articulates life&rsquo;s momentary  illuminations and then the moving on, the letting go of everything: youth,  dreams, old visions, realizations, and, inevitably, life itself.  The book is a chambered nautilus.&rdquo;<br />  Dr. Megan McClard, Professor Emeritus, Metropolitan State  College of Denver</p>  <p>&ldquo;Although poems of self-discovery may be common fare, these  spare verses go to the core of life as Diana Sher shows readers variations on  cutting the cord…Hope resides in this collection.&rdquo;<br /> Dr. Jackie Swensson, Conference on English Education, National  Council of Teacher&rsquo;s of English</p>  <p>&ldquo;<em>After I Cut the Cord</em> offers quietly provocative insights into many of life&rsquo;s small moments--the kind  of moments most of us overlook entirely.&rdquo;<br /> Linda Berry  <br /> Author of the Trudy Roundtree Mystery Novels </p>
