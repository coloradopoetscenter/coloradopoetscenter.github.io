  <h1>The Last Breath</h1>  <p>On a day when the sky<br /> Is a deep clear blue <br /> And the air is winter crisp<br /> I begin positioning myself<br /> Sorrow bearing down<br /> For the long hard labor<br /> We have made love for the last time<br /> The last tender Saturday morning<br /> Behind us<br /> The mortgage is paid off<br /> And my last period a dim youthful memory<br /> Even the last grandchild has arrived<br /> I can’t remember our last really good fight<br /> I may have thrown something<br /> And now<br /> I wait for the last breath <br /> We have learned to share so well<br /> It doesn’t matter which one of us<br />  Takes it. </p>  <p><em>(Cape Rock,</em> 35 (1)</p>
