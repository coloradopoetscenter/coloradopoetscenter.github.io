  <h1>The Woman Rabbi</h1>  <p>This is about an old Jewish lady<br /> Watching a young woman rabbi<br /> Pray in the synagogue<br /> Her body gently swaying<br /> Praising God<br /> This is about an old lady <br /> Who feels the song<br /> Moving within her<br /> Who hears the last plaintive note<br /> Of the shofar<br /> Calling to her <br /> On Yom Kippur<br /> An old lady <br /> Who sits in the synagogue<br /> Cursing<br /> Hashem, her God<br /> For not making women rabbis <br /> Sooner<br /> Cursing Adonai<br /> Who is everywhere in the universe<br /> In Her own language. </p>  <p><em>Kerem </em>Volume 12</p>
