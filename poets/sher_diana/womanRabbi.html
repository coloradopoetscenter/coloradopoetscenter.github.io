          <h1>The Woman Rabbi</h1>
          <p>This is about an old Jewish lady<br />
            Watching a young woman rabbi<br />
            Pray in the synagogue<br />
            Her body gently swaying<br />
            Praising God<br />
            This is about an old lady <br />
            Who feels the song<br />
            Moving within her<br />
            Who hears the last plaintive note<br />
            Of the shofar<br />
            Calling to her <br />
            On Yom Kippur<br />
            An old lady <br />
            Who sits in the synagogue<br />
            Cursing<br />
            Hashem, her God<br />
            For not making women rabbis <br />
            Sooner<br />
            Cursing Adonai<br />
            Who is everywhere in the universe<br />
            In Her own language.          </p>
          <p><em>Kerem </em>Volume 12</p>
