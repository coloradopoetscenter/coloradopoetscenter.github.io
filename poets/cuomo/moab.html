              <h1><strong> River Ride in Moab</strong></h1>
              <p> stiff as a branch </p>
              <p class="small"> I awaken </p>
              <p> perched on a rock overlooking moving waters </p>
              <p> bats fly over me </p>
              <p> I watch the river flow </p>
              <p><em> &lsquo;you are as slow as the river&rsquo;, </em></p>
              <p> he tells me. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> I watch the river </p>
              <p> slow is good </p>
              <p> I watch the slow moving river carrying me </p>
              <p> I spot a leaf on the river </p>
              <p> has it caught a ride </p>
              <p> was it a willing participant </p>
              <p> or did it fall in and <em>learn</em></p>
              <p> to let go </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> I imagine myself riding the river </p>
              <p> on this clear dark night </p>
              <p> with Venus twinkling </p>
              <p> next to a silver moon </p>
              <p> how perfect life is </p>
              <p> how utterly beautiful </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> if I were this leaf swirling </p>
              <p> on the Colorado river </p>
              <p> how would I see from the center </p>
              <p> would I describe my surroundings </p>
              <p> what animals would I see on the shores </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="large"> I sit </p>
              <p> spread my body on the river </p>
              <p class="large"> and float </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> there are red cliffs encircling me </p>
              <p class="large"> ravens echoing </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> when I have not remained alert </p>
              <p> whose journey have I missed </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="large"> as I turn </p>
              <p> a fish jumps to lick the moon. </p>
