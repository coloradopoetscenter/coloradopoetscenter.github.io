              <p>&ldquo;Reading Delphine Cuomo&rsquo;s poetry is like entering a sacred pool of ancient water, where what lies under the surface resembles the silk tapestry of dream, gratitude-praise, and the shining center of the human heart, and about, the honest earth and startling bright sky. </p>
              <p> Craig Nielsen (<em>Touch of Grace)</em></p>
              
              <p>&ldquo;You dig into the earth, where the earthy people are&hellip;poetry  that&rsquo;s grounded and a little bit outlaw, nonacademic: it&rsquo;s Beat, it&rsquo;s street,  it&rsquo;s desert, it&rsquo;s open spaces, it&rsquo;s landscape, it&rsquo;s human.&rdquo;</p>
              <p> - John Macker, poet  and editor of <em>Desert Shovel Review</em>.</p>
              <p>&rdquo;Macker contacted the poets he knew and others he had  studied for years. Their goal: to &lsquo;map the present coordinates of contemporary  poetry in America.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
