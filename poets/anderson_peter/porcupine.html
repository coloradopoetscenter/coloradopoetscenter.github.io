  <h1>The Ranger and the Porcupine</h1>  <p>They are both  solitary creatures who want to be left alone. </p>  <p>The ranger has  been swinging a Pulaski all day, clearing <br /> deadfall off of  highline trails⎯fifteen miles and twenty <br /> lodgepole taken  out at 10,000 feet.  Back at the wall  tent, <br /> he eats macs  and cheese, burrows into his bag, and reads <br /> Abbey by  kerosene until his lantern flares out like an old star.</p>  <p>The porcupine  wants salt and knows where to find it.<br /> He crawls under  the ranger’s floor and gnaws and gnaws <br /> and gnaws on  the plywood, loud as a bad memory, until <br /> the ranger  can’t stand it any longer. A million stars witness<br /> him in his  skivvies, as he flashes a beam under the cabin </p>  <p>and side-arms rocks  which throw sparks when they hit <br /> the old  stovepipe that is stashed there. Close may be good <br /> enough, he  thinks. He goes back to bed, but the gnawing <br /> resumes. Back  into the night, he is armed, this time, with <br /> the assembled  poles of a bivouac tent, which he wields </p>  <p>like a pool  cue. The porcupine huddles under the far corner <br /> of the cabin  floor, but the ranger still lands a direct hit <br /> on the quill  pig’s snout which, for a moment, he regrets. <br /> Then he  remembers his dog’s tongue hammered with quills <br /> and a one-eyed  coyote who hunts only on his good side.  </p>  <p>Finally, they  part ways, he thinks, as his nemesis waddles off <br /> into the dark  spruce. The ranger crawls back into his cocoon <br /> where he drifts  off into a vision of elk on a night ridge, echoing<br /> the bugling in  the meadow below his camp. Meantime, the <br /> porcupine finds  a pack saddle cinch, salted with horse sweat.</p>  <p>They are both  solitary creatures who want to be left alone.</p>
