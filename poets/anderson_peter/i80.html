          <h1>Night Drive on I-80 </h1>
          <p>Remember when you were headed west out of Wamsutter <br />
            Measuring the after midnight miles with a half-emptied sixpack<br />
          And you had the hammer down and nothing but empty up ahead?</p>
          <p>Remember, somewhere west of Bitter Creek, you stopped <br />
            for that  roughnecked  renegade leaning into the wind, who told <br />
            you he was so hungry he could eat the ass off a skunk?</p>
          <p>Remember the eatum-up truck stop neon, blazing like Christmas <br />
            with the voltage cranked and all those big buckets of bolts <br />
            blowing diesel in the parking lot ?</p>
          <p>Remember how your  roughneck  pal went silent over chicken fried steak, <br />
            and you picked at a piece of pie from the Pleistocene, but the  cat-eyed <br />
            waitress called you &ldquo;hun&rdquo; and made it all ok?</p>
          <p>Remember dropping your new friend off at daybreak⎯highway 189 <br />
            north to Diamondville⎯and how he told you to  keep the shiny <br />
            side up and the greasy side down, and how you said &ldquo;fer sure&rdquo; </p>
          <p>and how it was easier to believe, back then, that everyone <br />
            was a good buddy just waiting to happen?</p>
