  <h1>Out Past the Nowhere Café</h1>  <p>Soon it comes back to you, this loneliest road <br /> rhythm following a Nevada moon out of the troughs <br /> of the great ghost waves, beyond the pinyon summits, <br />  and down the far side of range after range, where there </p>  <p>is always another valley—greasewood, saltbush, alkali—<br /> and one less radio station. It takes longer to get nowhere <br /> than it used to. You see what looks like the glow of a small <br /> town over the rise, and you wonder if it’s real or maybe </p>  <p>some coffeed-up apparition, like that hitchhiking shadow <br /> a few miles back. You round a bend and there lies a dying <br /> town. Home of the Nowhere Café. Go slow. The café <br /> is easy to pass—they the shut the lights off years ago. </p>  <p>Out back, where the truckers used to park, you follow <br /> a road running south between the ranges they call Shoshone <br /> and Toiyabe. So close to nowhere now you’ve gone giddy. <br /> You hear yourself chanting: Shoshone, Toiyabe, Shoshone, Toiyabe. </p>  <p>You take the first two track turn, follow it out to the end, <br /> shut the lights off, shut the engine off, and sit tight till <br /> it stops ticking. Then you walk out over this desert  <br /> hardpan, wait for the first falling star, and you hear </p>  <p>nothing, not even a lick of wind. Finally you are nowhere. <br /> And you say the only words you have left to say: <br /> Empty me, that I might be whole again.</p>
