          <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          <p>…there is a wiry toughness  and physicality to Anderson’s writing. Without sentimentalizing, he shows us  the night-blooming primrose, the coyotes, the names and contours of particular  mountain ranges, and the hard facts of what the shape of the land does to the  air, water, and creatures that move over it.  <br />
                                      --Greg Wolfe, <em>Image</em></p>
          <p>…a fluid and graceful writer <br />
            --Ed Quillen, <em>Denver Post</em></p>
          <p>…wise and witty<br />
            --Art Goodtimes, Poet Laureate,  Western Slope, Colorado</p>
          <p>…Colorado  author and Quaker Peter Anderson leads us humbly and with respect for the  wonders he encounters. Many authors would provide far too much chatter and  conceit on this journey. Peter is a fine, gentle companion on a walk through  wild country.<br />
            --Margaret  Pettis, poet, editor <em>The Lynx</em></p>
