            <h1>Firebreak
            </h1>
            <p>the winnowing time is back again<br />
              <span class="left">it lengthens with each pass</span><br />
  threshing out, fleshing out<br />
  <span class="left">faithworthiness, the task</span></p>
            <p>the chaff and wheat resemble one<br />
              <span class="left">another&mdash;there&rsquo;s the rub</span><br />
  between the wheels of growth and death<br />
  <span class="left">the grain comes forth with blood</span></p>
            <p>chaff and wheat, goats and sheep<br />
              <span class="left">separation comes</span><br />
  in good and forward-looking steps<br />
  <span class="left">to cull the harvest home</span></p>
            <p>distinguishing is difficult<br />
              <span class="left">the two mix and disguise</span><br />
  the past can prove false counsel<br />
  <span class="left">for the crops can change their sides</span></p>
            <p>truth hides within the millstone<br />
              <span class="left">invisible and hard</span><br />
  around the neck it weighs and drowns<br />
  <span class="left">flat, it grinds forth food</span></p>
            <p>always unexpected, what<br />
              <span class="left">final division shows</span><br />
  the husk conceals hope, wisdom<br />
  <span class="left">and straight gold wheat betrays</span></p>
            <p>God&rsquo;s ways can be unethical,<br />
              <span class="left">immoral, even, says</span><br />
  a weed tossed by the wayside<br />
  <span class="left">tramped down but reborn,</span></p>
            <p>for ethics are for neat-plowed rows<br />
              <span class="left">untouched by searing thread</span><br />
  the scars of war teach different ways<br />
  <span class="left">to grasp life by the hand</span></p>
            <p>sacramental bounty grows<br />
              <span class="left">despite each season&rsquo;s deaths</span><br />
  the autumn&rsquo;s sadness also calls<br />
  <span class="left">each bleeding grain to feast</span></p>
