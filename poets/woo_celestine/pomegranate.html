              <h1>Pomegranate Seed
              </h1>
              <p>Pomegranate Seed <br />
                today I journeyed back<br />
                to the pocked realm of the pomegranate flesh<br />
                dry, wafer-colored, pasty chalk<br />
                of neatened decades <br />
                and mortified citizens<br />
                eschewing the bloody, roiling otherworld<br />
                of the seed<br />
          where I now indwell</p>
              <p>embraced,<br />
                my flesh has prospered</p>
              <p>I skated down its creamy concavities<br />
                felt the tug of familiarity<br />
                skipped and skidded its serried slopes<br />
                butterflies winged their way about<br />
                chittering my old language<br />
                I have become a fish<br />
          wriggling red liquid depths</p>
              <p>what do they dream<br />
                the butterflies of this field<br />
                of flesh and ice<br />
                dusty-winged, encrusted<br />
                enmeshed by flittery colors and concerns<br />
                do they alight to ever recognize<br />
                the unimagined fish<br />
                world of wet wonder<br />
          ocean of juice, sweet, staining, sensual, sloppy</p>
              <p>sterile eyes of fleshy butterflies<br />
                in the wide wide field of fruit<br />
                housing, hymeneally,<br />
                (missing the point, the puncture)<br />
                the smaller but oh<br />
                more succulent<br />
                cherry<br />
                between the hollowed lips, framing the fruit<br />
                created to be pressed, burst<br />
                sucked<br />
                penetrated to pulsing red wet<br />
          ecstasy of taste</p>
