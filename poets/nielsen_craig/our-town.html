<h1>Our Town </h1>
<p> He drove east </p>
<p> through the stone canyon, </p>
<p> ducks lifting off the river, </p>
<p> their wings a hurried rapture. </p>
<p> He let the last daylight absorb into him, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> felt the evening hush settle around him. </p>
<p> He noticed the souls of small houses, </p>
<p> a nesting of decipherable bones </p>
<p> gathered in the rolling hills, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> noticed the neoned liquor stores </p>
<p> and hungered churches </p>
<p> stemming off the highway, </p>
<p> the sixteen squared prisons </p>
<p> glaring on two horizons, </p>
<p> noticed the guard in the white sedan </p>
<p> warming up his anger. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> He read the bumper sticker </p>
<p> on the truck: &ldquo;Garbage Kills Bears.&rdquo; </p>
<p> He noticed the full gun rack in the back window. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> He steadied his eyes in the graying light, </p>
<p> drove north over the shoulder </p>
<p> of the red mountain, </p>
<p> beyond the vast, lighted complex, </p>
<p> eerily empty, beyond the caved mountain fortress, </p>
<p> its baleful towers spiking the sky, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> beyond the campuses of heaven. </p>
<p> He parked the car, </p>
<p> boarded the plane and flew west </p>
<p> into the steel night, </p>
<p> over the patterned expanse below, </p>
<p> touching other towns, </p>
<p> uneasy with the distance, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> into shadows over the wintry summits of mountains </p>
<p> plush with moonlight and stillness. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> He imagined bears resting </p>
<p> beneath a cover of new snow. </p>
<p> And beyond, a town </p>
<p> gleaming bright, </p>
<p> untouched by God. </p>
