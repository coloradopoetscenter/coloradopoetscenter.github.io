          <h1>Eduardo</h1>
          <p> (originally published in Indiana Review)</p>
          <p>I was thinking about beauty, in particular<br />
          yours, you who are not by your own admission</p>
          <p>beautiful, when the old bird down by the gatepost<br />
            started uttering his song, the one I think means</p>
          <p>joy, but with an undertone of terror. The bird,<br />
            apart from his being a queen in the way he carries</p>
          <p>on, is neither beautiful nor pure. I despise the clock<br />
            of his ruby throat, and because of the way I've watched him</p>
          <p>root a metal can for grub, then turn that filth to music,<br />
            I have thought to take him down. But with what?</p>
          <p>I've got no gun to speak of, and once in my hands,<br />
            what would I do with that terrible scrap of scarlet?</p>
