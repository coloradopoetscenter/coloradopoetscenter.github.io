          <h1>To an Old Queen Getting Dressed</h1>
          <p> (originally published in Waccamaw)</p>
          <p>She was an old queen; I was freshly out.<br />
            She'd taken me under her massive wing<br />
            and paraded me at parties. Her thing<br />
          was to be seen, always. Sometimes I'd sit</p>
          <p>for hours in her parlor – for what else could<br />
            I call that bazar of flounce, chintz, feathers,<br />
            all new to me; in her closet, leathers,<br />
            whips, boots she didn't wear, from what she called</p>
          <p>dismissively her 'bad decade of butch'.<br />
            I'd thumb a magazine; she'd light a joint.<br />
            I tried maintaining a façade of faint,<br />
            masculine disinterest. She'd call me 'bitch'.</p>
          <p> 'Who wants,' she asked, 'a body under siege?'<br />
            adjusting the light, searching her mirror<br />
            for acne scars, or smudge of Sarcoma,<br />
            all dusted out in a snowdrift of rouge.</p>
          <p>Old. She called our preferred bar 'a single<br />
            church, lacking dominant motif,' meaning<br />
            bears, twinks, the academe, bikers leaning<br />
            against one wall, refusing to mingle,</p>
          <p>all, as far as she was concerned, welcome<br />
            to congregate, and she greeted each with equal<br />
            amity, a sort of priest, or regal<br />
            queen stepped down from her throne as each one came.</p>
          <p>'Not to mention, we've the handsomest choir<br />
            boys this side of' – but there, a coughing fit<br />
            would intervene. She was sick. Felt unfit<br />
            to love anymore, or at least 'no more</p>
          <p>in a focused sense'. Lust, on the other hand,<br />
            still had its place: her shelves, with glass ashtrays,<br />
            tourist kitsch, postcards from the seventies,<br />
            requisite novels, although she didn't</p>
          <p>read, displayed a veritable Who's Who<br />
            of lust, pre-condom mostly, or vintage,<br />
            as they say, thus giving even bondage<br />
            flicks an air of dignity. I didn't know</p>
          <p>if she watched it anymore. Her former<br />
            friends, in exquisite frames, were dead; she had<br />
            helped bury them, and somehow eluded<br />
            death in the interim. As informer,</p>
          <p>rather than target, she said, was how she served,<br />
            persuading death – although she hadn't tried –<br />
            to pass over, watching it, silent, glide<br />
            down to some other who must have deserved </p>
          <p>it more – or so she confessed to feeling<br />
            at times, trying to reason why she'd survived<br />
            where even her enemies hadn't. Contrived<br />
            explanations left her sad head reeling.</p>
          <p>Among the dead, although I didn't ask,<br />
            had to have been lovers – I didn't know<br />
            to ask –and she and I were there for show,<br />
            the endless present ending in a mask</p>
          <p>she kept donning in the hospital bed<br />
            insisting, whatever the doctors did,<br />
            needles and blood work, sponge baths in the bed,<br />
            to keep her beard and moustache shaved, her head</p>
          <p>dignified as I could fashion, which meant<br />
            wiping spittle from her chin, and learning<br />
            to sense which way it was her body meant<br />
            to go and, without waking her, turning</p>
          <p>her that direction. In the parking lot<br />
            I'd smoke, scanning through The Smiths' The Queen<br />
            Is Dead, first the comical &quot;Vicar in<br />
            a Tutu,&quot; then the sinister &quot;Cemetry Gates.&quot;</p>
