          <h1>Post-Barium</h1>
          <p> (originally published in Boston Review)</p>
          <p>Last week they lit your insides up<br />
            by sci-fi periscope: and your insides, up<br />
            on the doctor's screen, blazed like a colonist's map<br />
          of the Congo: wherever the empire had set up shop</p>
          <p>down the rich green river-stink<br />
            were trading posts of pink<br />
            or outposts of rot<br />
            inverted pink that couldn't be got<br />
            at easily, by knife, nor chemo shrink.</p>
          <p>Tonight you're passed out cold<br />
            on the couch – valerian cut into dope. We're old<br />
            acquaintances; I'm keeping watch, take my occasional leave<br />
            for a smoke on your iced balcony. We've</p>
          <p>been through this before: first Curtis, one blasted<br />
            summer, going fast; then Farmer, who lasted<br />
            longer. I've managed to wind up clean – breathed<br />
            dead hippo meat so to speak and not be contaminated –<br />
            that last bit lifted directly from Joseph Conrad.</p>
