<h1>Critical  Commentary:</h1>
<p>&quot;With  the focus of flame, Sandra Dorr illuminates what we love, in her seeing, as it  opens, closes, is, and is  not.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Kim Stafford</p>
<p>&quot;These poems reiterate  world&mdash;its animal weight, its succulence, its liveness.&nbsp; Dorr knows that  only by way of the multitudinous, minute particulars may we enter the  Oneness.&quot;<br />
Marilyn Krysl</p>
<p> &ldquo;&rsquo;Lilly Makes an A&rsquo; is a  present-tense narrative of a domestic experience. The parent in the poem's  kitchen watches her daughter learn to make the alphabet and graphically  remembers her own experiences as a schoolgirl...The poem is a multilayered  vision about language and learning language... I chose &lsquo;Lilly Makes an A&rsquo; for  its word play and sensuous description of how we come to make language.&rdquo;<br /> Diane Wakoski, judge, New Discovery Poetry  Award</p>
