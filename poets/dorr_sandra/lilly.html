              <h1>Lilly Makes An A</h1>
              <p>My  daughter sits in the kitchen with a square of paper,<br />
                her  big black shoes crossed tight under the chair.<br />
                When  the teakettle whees, I tip it up<br />
                and  watch her dark brown stare, intent as a sparrow&rsquo;s, <br />
                following  the letter curving out of her gripped pencil.<br />
                In  her eyes I see the black linoleum<br />
                of  St. Helena&rsquo;s hallways, shining like urine<br />
                on  a cloudy winter day. Water melting from black rubber boots<br />
                in  a row, the cloakroom smelling of feet and snow.<br />
                In  front of our desks Sister Mary Francis <br />
                outlines  our first letters on a blackboard.<br />
                White  flakes twirl down windows.<br />
                A  tall, black robed woman against black --<br />
                nothing  else showing of how she stood<br />
                nor  how her long legs met her hips<br />
                or  the smooth muscle of her arms shivered.<br />
                Instead  the blazingly white chalk meets the hard board.<br />
                Her  voice startlingly calm, sweet as a flower:&nbsp; <br />
  &ldquo;Children,  take out a piece of lined paper.&rdquo;<br />
                The  acrid rubber nipple of a curved glue bottle <br />
                on  the corner of my desk smells orange like the wood, <br />
                perfume  soaked into the room.<br />
                I  put it in my mouth and suck on it to stop<br />
                the  excitement in my stomach that spurted up<br />
                when  I put my pencil to the soft page<br />
                the  way she touched the board with her stick of chalk.<br />
                I  am making a letter, a mark on the page <br />
                that  grows out of my body like a root in a cage, <br />
                a  tall black shape beautiful and strange.<br />
                It  will tell everyone what I cannot say.<br />
                When  I look up, she smiles at me.<br />
                We  are speaking, the sister and I.<br />
                A  hot wave begins carrying me out of the high<br />
                square  windows, over the black upright piano,<br />
                beyond  the rows of heads shining like brown pennies.<br />
                My  body quivers: <br />
          my  voice is louder than God&rsquo;s. </p>
              <p>We  put the pencil boxes away.<br />
                Look,  Lilly says.<br />
          I  made an A.</p>
              <p><em>Rosebud</em></p>
