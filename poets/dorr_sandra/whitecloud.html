<h1>White  Cloud</h1>
<p>The white  cloud is not afraid<br />to pass  through the black mountain.<br />She floats  like breath, the warm arms<br />of a mother  in the sky<br />drifting  gentle over the world,<br />dissolving  toothed peaks<br />that swell,  streaked with mist.<br />She sleeps  in the sky,<br />becomes  water, becomes a crooked pi&ntilde;on,<br />a woman  carrying a bundle,<br />a boy under  a three-hundred-year oak<br />over and  over playing a note<br />  on a small  harmonica.</p>
