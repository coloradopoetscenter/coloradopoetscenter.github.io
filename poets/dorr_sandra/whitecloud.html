              <h1>White  Cloud</h1>
              <p>The white  cloud is not afraid<br />
                to pass  through the black mountain.<br />
                She floats  like breath, the warm arms<br />
                of a mother  in the sky<br />
                drifting  gentle over the world,<br />
                dissolving  toothed peaks<br />
                that swell,  streaked with mist.<br />
                She sleeps  in the sky,<br />
                becomes  water, becomes a crooked pi&ntilde;on,<br />
                a woman  carrying a bundle,<br />
                a boy under  a three-hundred-year oak<br />
                over and  over playing a note<br />
          on a small  harmonica.</p>
