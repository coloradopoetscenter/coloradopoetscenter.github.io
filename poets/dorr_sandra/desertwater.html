<h1>Desert Water</h1>
<p>For G.M.H.</p>
<p>Summoned by the desert washed smell of  water <br />
we go down into high ken of rock and river, <br />
wind-stirred trees along the blue shimmer <br />
running wild-loud over hard dry fodder. <br />
Hawks and redwings trill above bullfrog  gutter. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been centuries since I heard this  sound over and over.&nbsp; <br />Cold water touches an old well, makes me  remember <br />the hands of long ago, silted root, rock  and alder <br />buried under longing to know, the same slow  circle&nbsp; <br />  eddying and eddying in the current&rsquo;s  middle. </p>
<p>Time, incomprehensible, is the river moving  at dusk. <br />Bodies of water come from water, in this  grotto <br />we yield to it all the fury of the heart:  what was sought <br />and not won.&nbsp; Our children lost, unsung.&nbsp; The world <br />  of dreams laid open.&nbsp; You, once mine, gone. </p>
<p>Look.&nbsp;  Up, under the sagging bridge a swell <br />of swallows swirls over the water, plunges,  arcs <br />up in mid-air, glitters green against white  cliffs, <br />flies to the beating rushes, sings through  trees <br />  while the river below glistens, breathes  through </p>
<p>each body, aware.&nbsp; We have come to the great <br />mystery, always emptying, always there, <br /><em>the dearest freshness deep down things,</em><br />this open canyon rippling river water, <br />  these light fluttering blankets of wings.</p>
