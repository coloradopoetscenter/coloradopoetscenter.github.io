<h1>Wild Mustard</h1>
<p>Abandoning the paper on the driveway,<br />
I walk out into the  stillness tasting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
the night&rsquo;s rain, sage and juniper&nbsp; <br />pale silver in the dazzled light tilting  the buttes, <br />
a cloud of blue mesa lying on the horizon. <br />
Off the wind pours an  unmistakable scent <br />
from the first tips of green standing in  water,<br />a speck of purple blossom I scoop up<br />on my finger to smell its scraggy moist  leaf, <br />its perfect four-petalled cross <br />sprung up through the hard brown clay of winter:<br />wild mustard, the desert&rsquo;s first flower.<br />How can something so small awaken this  land, <br />this lingering bittersweet greenness<br />that makes my body tremble for more of its  fragrance<br />as it drifts through this bright air,  announces its presence<br />to the horses standing in their shimmered  stances,<br />the flying bellies of geese<br />the child tying a string on her bike,<br />and I who stand dumbstruck <br />  in a field of wild sweet mustard.</p>
<p>What is it in this life I cannot find?&nbsp; <br />What god is it I am looking for?</p>
<p><em>Open  Spaces</em></p>
