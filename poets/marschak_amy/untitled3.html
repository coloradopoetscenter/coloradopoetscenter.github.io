          <p align="center">If a dog stopped playing <br />
            When he became an adult<br />
            Everyone would ask, &ldquo;What  is wrong with that poor dog?&rdquo;<br />
            And he would be taken to  the vet.<br />
            But when we are adults and  begin to work<br />
            And stop our play<br />
            Does anyone take us to the  doctor?</p>
