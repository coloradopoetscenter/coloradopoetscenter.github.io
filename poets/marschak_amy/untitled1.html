<h1>I Was So Busy Listening To The Radio</h1>  <p>I was so  busy listening to the radio, <br /> I forgot  my own song <br /> And didn’t  hear my own words, </p>  <p>I was so  busy listening to the radio, <br /> I forgot  what I was thinking, <br /> And what  my heart was trying to tell me. </p>  <p>I was so  busy listening to the radio, <br /> I forgot  who I was <br /> But I get  the feeling sex is the answer, <br /> After all  isn’t that what the radio says. </p>  <p><em>Poem from &quot;Poetry for  All Those Breathing&quot;</em></p>  <p><a href="http://www.epoemsaboutlife.com/?page_id=38">Buy<em> &quot;Poetry for  All Those Breathing&quot;</em></a></p>
