          <h1 class="text-center">Untitled Poem</h1>
          <p align="center">An arm, a leg, an eye, a tongue, <br />
          These are the prizes the soldiers  have won. </p>
          <p align="center">But mom that&rsquo;s not all <br />
            They&rsquo;ve got Saul, </p>
          <p align="center">An arm, a leg, an eye, a tongue, <br />
            That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left of Saul <br />
            That&rsquo;s all. </p>
          <p align="center">He&rsquo;s dead mom <br />
            He&rsquo;s dead. </p>
          <p align="center">&ldquo;Thank the good Lord,&rdquo; <br />
            My mother said. <br />
  &ldquo;For if he were alive <br />
            In the hands of the soldiers <br />
            He&rsquo;d ask the good Lord why. <br />
            Why did God give him life <br />
            To be treated like a spider <br />
            Whose fallen prey </p>
          <p align="center">To children&rsquo;s games <br />
            They rip off its legs <br />
            And watch him squirm <br />
            And laugh, <br />
            And laugh, <br />
            And these are the games <br />
            That children play.&quot; </p>
          <p align="center">An arm, a leg, an eye, a tongue, <br />
            These are the prizes the soldiers  have won. <br />
            They show their trophies proudly, <br />
            Sure signs of their victory. </p>
          <p align="center">An arm, a leg, an eye, a tongue, </p>
          <p align="center">The trophies <br />
            They won <br />
            Were part of my son. </p>
