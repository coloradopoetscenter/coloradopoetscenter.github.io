<h1>Biography</h1> <p>Growing up in an abusive family, I wrote poetry, prose, plays  and essays, to escape the world I was living in.  The act of writing gave me hope and rereading  my own words was comforting and inspiring to me.  As I grew up and shared what I wrote with  other people, I was told that my writings are amazing and have given people  hope, inspiration and validation.</p> <p> I have been interviewed for numerous newspapers, radio shows and  television and have received much critical acclaim.  I have also been invited to tour my  autobiographical play &quot;An Angel Cried A Tear Last Night&quot; coast to  coast in the United States and Canada.The video of it is available at <a href="http://humantheatre.org/ticketclips2.html">http://humantheatre.org/ticketclips2.html</a></p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axKs1_MUlMo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  <p> My book &quot;Poetry for All Those Breathing&quot; is in its  eighth printing and has inspired others to go past their writer's block and  write again.&nbsp; More of my poetry and my book are at <a href="http://www.epoemsaboutlife.com/">http://www.epoemsaboutlife.com</a></p> <p> I am currently performing and touring my improv poetry.  </p> <p> <em>&quot;</em><em>Laugh, be  moved and experience spontaneous word craftsmanship!&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy Marschak,  The Improv Poet, has the creativity and courage to bring a poem to life using  word(s) or phrase(s) provided by the audience.&nbsp; Come on by, bring your  suggestions, and right before your very eyes (and ears) a unique, unexpected,  improvised poetry performance will appear.&quot;</em> </p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z6vZ-T6TgE4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  <p> I am available to perform improv poetry at events, to lead  poetry workshops and do personal poetry and performance coaching.  Two of my poetry workshops are&quot;Writing  Poetry: Letting It Be Easy&quot; and &quot;How to Perform A Poem With  Vibrance&quot;.As an NYU graduate, I  can use my acting, writing and improv experience to customize the perfect  workshop for your event.  For more  Information about my improv poetry go to <a href="http://www.improvpoet.com/">http://www.ImprovPoet.com</a></p>  <p>Questions?
