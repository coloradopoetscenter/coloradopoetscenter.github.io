  <h1>I Have Forgotten</h1>  <p>I  have forgotten to hear <br /> The  music of my own voice <br /> Of  love itself <br />  And  of faith. </p>  <p>I  have forgotten to hear <br /> The  songs of the birds <br /> The  crackling of branches <br /> And  the chiming of the leaves. </p>  <p>I  have forgotten <br /> To  hear my own heart <br /> To  know my own dreams <br /> Allow  them to happen <br /> And  be. </p>  <p>I  have forgotten <br /> What  my soul has once known <br /> I  have forgotten <br /> And  now Iâ€™m beginning... <br /> To  remember. </p>  <p><em>Poem from &quot;Poetry for  All Those Breathing&quot;</em></p>  <p><a href="http://www.epoemsaboutlife.com/?page_id=38">Buy <em>&quot;Poetry for All Those Breathing&quot;</em></a></p>
