      <h1>Where Do the Words</h1>
      <p>Where do the words come from?Â   Not from the sea</p>
      <p> Smothering its secrets in crab holes,</p>
      <p> Whispering its lays as a single hiss</p>
      <p> Of thoughtless spill.</p>
      <p class="indent">Not from that tree</p>
      <p> Cliff bound, weeping its olive tears</p>
      <p> Into limestone wells, a mouthless mourning</p>
      <p> Of silent will.</p>
      <p class="indent">And not from me--</p>
      <p> I study both and try by mute gaze </p>
      <p> To stay a passing soul who, hearing no name,</p>
      <p>Descends the hill.</p>
