<h1>Why Writing Poetry Is So Easy</h1><p>Remember when you knocked your mother's crystal<br />  Tortoise from the end table?  You  hadn&rsquo;t meant to--<br />  You spun to outdraw the mirror<br />  And caught the weight full<br />  With an elbow, parked, as it was, too close<br />  To the edge.  Density itself  sailed to the floor;<br />  Striking the threshold,<br />  Shattered into a thousand splinters.  <br />  Wouldn't you know the damn thing would<br />  Miss the carpet, otherwise wall to wall,<br />  And explode into razor eggs.  Now<br />  In some other city, on the floor of your own house,<br />  You put your hand down.  A dot<br />  Of glass pricks your thumb, the tiniest hole.<br />  But you can hardly stem the flow.</p>
