              </ul>
              
             
        
        
        <h1>Gershwin Visits</h1>
        <p>1. <br />
          One hundred glass pianos<br />
          Connected by ladders.<br />
          Among the rungs my father hangs,<br />
        Humming those tunes.</p>
        <p>2.<br />
          Ivory cigarette holder<br />
          Clenched at a presidential angle.<br />
          Smoke, a tenor line,<br />
        Floats through the fretted grill.</p>
        <p>3.<br />
          From his height my father nails a talisman<br />
          To each doorpost. <br />
          Jessel, Benny, the bat of Hank Greenberg,<br />
          The mash of those crushing harmonies.<br />
          And where he was seen--<br />
          Sardi's, the Brown Derby.  Best of all,<br />
          Himself <br />
          Captured by the Path√© camera,<br />
        A day on the beach with Harpo.</p>
        <p>4.<br />
          Foot-high swells of Rhapsody in Blue, surfing clarinet.<br />
          Not the New   Land discovered<br />
          But the plate tectonics that<br />
          Move the island under him, aligned in the Hudson<br />
        Pointing north like a needle.</p>
        <p>5. <br />
          Notes nail a trellis.<br />
          Notes soldered to staff, thirteenths<br />
          Dropped in the street, sharped ninths<br />
          Stuck on the Williamsburg   Bridge where they<br />
          Could flatten a tire. Look at that, will you?<br />
          Somebody must have spilled them off the back<br />
        Of a truck.</p>
        <p>6.<br />
          When he spoke over the surf,<br />
        What did Harpo say?</p>
        <p>7. <br />
          My father humming the tunes, <br />
          Shot by his roadster, tan upholstery, glissands<br />
          Across the wire-strung bridge to the Riviera.<br />
          The Riviera  burns down, Oscar Levant dies smoking<br />
          His sponsor's product.<br />
          Photographs<br />
        Slip loose from the heavy black page.</p>
        <p>8.<br />
          Score for Klezmer horns and drums, <br />
          Drum heads white and starched, <br />
          Boiled shirt fronts, licorice sticks, <br />
          Keyboards from slides in the parks,<br />
        From chained swings down slides and up ladders.</p>
        <p>9.<br />
          His fingers sit the keys,<br />
          Tent the keys, twelve fingers<br />
          Sit the see saw of his chords, monochromatic<br />
          Sequence, black on white rotogravure.<br />
  <em>Wont you tell him please to put on some speed,</em><br />
  <em>Follow my lead</em> <br />
          My mother sings over the linen's fold, wet<br />
          Perfume of ironing and wood,<br />
          Watching over me, over me<br />
          A brown gravy covers me, carrot<br />
          And brisket alike. Sweet scent on the wind, <br />
        Gravy steam rising.</p>
        <p>10.<br />
          In newsreels he and Harpo wear striped robes.<br />
          My father wears white.<br />
          Scallop-edged prints fit neatly in triangular pockets<br />
          That we have glued to the page. <br />
        The glue is drying.</p>
        <p>11.<br />
          The youth of them all rises, <br />
          A cloud over a warm island.<br />
          Distant and gradually moving at us,<br />
        Blowing at us, full of the chill rain of time.</p>
