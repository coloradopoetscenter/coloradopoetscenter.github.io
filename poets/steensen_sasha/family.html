              <h1>Family</h1>
              <p>If family is a  body, learn its anatomy:<br />
                It has the head  of a house.<br />
                Each room is a  chamber of the brain.<br />
                Contrary to  popular illustration, the windows are not eyes, but teeth.<br />
                It is  impossible to tell whether a house is smiling or frowning.<br />
                Are the members  of its body subterranean, perhaps the roots of nearby trees?<br />
                Or, are the  limbs hung for the neighbors to see, the head shaded heartily above? <br />
                The members  need water in the hot Summer, and the beauty of their Fall leaves are a sign &nbsp; of death. <br />
  &nbsp;But here comes nearby Spring, if the trees can  just survive the Winter as they have for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yrs  &amp; yrs.<br />
                It heard its  own head, sorting these parts out.<br />
  &ldquo;Doom is the  House without / the Door&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
              <p>There have been  some makeshift additions.<br />
  &nbsp;In the basement, among the mold, discarded  toys, musical instruments, and Christmas &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decorations,  its heart beats solemnly on.&nbsp; <br />
                A deep freeze  sits nearby holding pounds of meat, frozen vegetables from the Fall &nbsp; harvest, bones for the dog, and other  miscellany.&nbsp; <br />
                A ribcage. A  ribcage. A ribcage.<br />
                The deck  overlooking our property provides an aerial view of all that is outside, of all  the &nbsp;&nbsp; foreign bodies that enter with each  breath.<br />
                The house,  heated by wood-burning stoves, has an invisible respiratory system.&nbsp; <br />
                Each time a  member leaves, it takes a body that needs to go out into the world and brings &nbsp; back a body that needs to enter the family.<br />
                When you are  outside looking in, you see windows lit in estranged light.<br />
          When you are  inside looking out, you see worlds lit in strange light.</p>
