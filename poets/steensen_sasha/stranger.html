              <h1>The Strander at the Gates</h1>
              <p>I thought:</p>
              <p><em>The Method, </em>so happily recovered.<br />
                Iam the one who called us all together.<br />
                I driven time<br />
                I wars and  waves <br />
                I was<br />
                I go over  sea-lanes rife with fish<br />
          I did not.</p>
              <p>I saw a shadow  on the water.<br />
                I know this  situation makes a perfect poem,<br />
                but I will not.<br />
                I want to write  that I&rsquo;ve already been to Jupiter,<br />
                but I have not,<br />
                or that  Catholicism died in the darkness <br />
          of the already  dark ages.</p>
              <p>I a man  mountain, a level island.<br />
                I a side-road.<br />
                I a dead toad  on the side-road,<br />
                can only say  what I&rsquo;ve seen with my own eyes.<br />
                The heart  inside us shakes <br />
          aswirl with  evil.</p>
              <p>I the eye in  the wading pool<br />
                bathed in  shame.<br />
                I sing for our  time too.<br />
                I planned to  follow all the &ldquo;I&rsquo;s&rdquo; <br />
                I could find.<br />
                I ahaze. <br />
                Not even the  geese could make their way.<br />
          I sit down on  the curb and wait.</p>
              <p>Listen.<br />
                I loved him.<br />
                Our hour sat  and sulked<br />
                but I a second  hand<br />
                did not budge.<br />
                I an  automobile.<br />
                I a blast  furnace ensnared.<br />
                I a home like  all the others in my neighborhood.<br />
                I at some other  century <br />
                imaginary love  affair<br />
                with heifers  and others<br />
          left like a  stranded hair.</p>
              <p>I told you <br />
                I&rsquo;d tell your  story<br />
                if you just let  me tell it. <br />
                I an  embellishment<br />
          before the  roads of the world grew dark.</p>
              <p>I a moon making  its way round.<br />
                I hate a  metaphor.<br />
                I pissed on the  sidewalk.<br />
                I did not.<br />
                I heard her  heartbeat fifteen times<br />
                before she was  born.<br />
                I a final glow  of antiquity.<br />
                I &ldquo;a method of  exhaustion.&rdquo;<br />
                I felt her bare  foot from the inside.<br />
                I streak the  administration.<br />
                I bare myself  too,<br />
                my breast to  the moon <br />
          making its way  round.</p>
              <p>I resent you<br />
                who I serve.<br />
                I said I would  say<br />
                what you want<br />
                but say it my  way.<br />
                I a television,  a television.<br />
                I a giant model  heart<br />
                touring the  city-state <br />
                before slaves<br />
                in the  birthplace<br />
                the cradle,  etc..<br />
                I a swallow in  your sight<br />
          loosed the sack  and all the winds blew past.</p>
              <p>I dolled out my  time<br />
                and money.<br />
                I was broke  before <br />
                the reformation<br />
                the  resurrection<br />
          and the  restoration.</p>
              <p>I a heathendom.<br />
                I a saintdom.<br />
                I a polka dot.<br />
                I  cock-of-the-walk<br />
                cocksure,  yelping<br />
                put beeswax in  my ears.<br />
                I a dog in  obedience class<br />
          who can no  longer hear.</p>
              <p>I say what you  want me to say.<br />
                I say how  brave.<br />
                I say how  clever.<br />
                I say how we  went together<br />
                happily. <br />
                How you loved  me.<br />
                How we became a  we<br />
                and I died and  you lived on<br />
          restored and  pretty.</p>
