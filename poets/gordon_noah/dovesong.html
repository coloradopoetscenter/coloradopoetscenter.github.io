              <h1>Dove  Song </h1>
              <p>A dove makes a sentence in the window <br />
                unendurably the lack of dove </p>
              <p>This plausible form thinks itself a garden <br />
                predicate to the shape of dove ideas</p>
              <p>Now the air is thick, internal<br />
                A dove makes a sentence in the window</p>
              <p>&amp; a dove-made, noun-less conjecture <br />
                makes of the thinker a vacant dove sound </p>
              <p>This plausible form thinks itself a garden<br />
                unpunctuated by reckless duration </p>
              <p>reiterated from margin to margin, where<br />
                a dove makes a sentence in the window</p>
              <p>unrestrained, a concerted dimmer silence<br />
                The weight of dove &amp; the waiting dove</p>
