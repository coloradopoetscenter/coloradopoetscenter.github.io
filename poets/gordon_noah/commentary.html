<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>

<p>Noah Eli  Gordon's poems take the form of jotted notes in an artist's notebook (I was  reminded in particular of Odilon Redon's). Each day one begins anew to weave  the web, having moved a step forward (or sometimes backward) since yesterday's  attempt. Thus each prose bloc, modified or modulated by the ghostly fragments  that interleave them, sharpens the focus by which he &quot;attempt[s] via the  unknown to give grammar a purpose.&quot; The effort in itself is its own  reward, and a prodigal one.<br />
--<strong>John Ashbery</strong></p>

<p>Such a new century deserves the sexual, the scientific, and  the utterly secular pleasure of building&nbsp;a poem&nbsp;with the tectonics of  a great bridge. So little pathos and so many paths. Broken like the heteronyms  of Pessoa, but filled with multiple lives, Noah Eli Gordon teases all false  monumentality yet reserves its rights to memory. To call it witty or wild isn't  witty or wild enough and leaves out the cavalier, the paideia,&nbsp;and  structural surge. He has the restless tones and narrative density of a septet.  His work itself glows green with surprises.&nbsp; He is a painter, of course. <br />--<strong>David Shapiro</strong></p>
<p>You can fairly hear the pinging of the world and all its  parts&mdash;noises of earth&rsquo;s objects rubbing against each other and the spheres. In  this ebullient music find the translation of colors, shapes, space, speech,  integrity, destruction. It&rsquo;s as if the world&rsquo;s most believable cape were thrown  back and below we found not a sham of seasons but all the body&rsquo;s most dynamic  possibilities.<br />--<strong>Eleni Sikelianos</strong></p>
<p>I am inclined to read Noah Eli Gordon&rsquo;s new book from the  perspective of a thousand years, when nature and artifice will have fused into  bird-encircled circuitries of song. In other words, in other worlds, is where  this writing&rsquo;s sand-clock accumulates its evidence. Yet Gordon demonstrates  that, even as names fall away from their referents, they also claim the right  of return. Here, every word holds its own echo, as if spoken inside a space  helmet, and assumes a vexed convexity of mirror that allows the accidental to slide  into the essential.<br />--<strong>Andrew Joron</strong></p>

<p>Can we, as poets, create texts  about how we think and feel by using the language of how others think and feel?  Can we compose with the new streams of language flowing in and around us (e.g.  the ephemera and minutia of everyday email) to express our own place in the  world?&nbsp; In a well-informed gesture beyond  Baudrillard&rsquo;s null set, Noah Eli Gordon&rsquo;s book-length conceptual poem, <em>INBOX</em>, opens a new chapter of  intimacy&mdash;his, yours, mine, ours. Welcome to a new subjectivity; welcome to a  new way to say <em>from the heart.</em><br />

<p>It was the Russian Formalist critics who first noted that  one of the historic roles of art &ndash; and one of art's inexorable drivers toward  incessant, ongoing change &ndash; is to incorporate new aspects of society into the  art itself. Without which any genre would very quickly lose much of its  connectedness with the life of the community from which it springs. <em>Inbox</em> is exactly what its title suggests, a work of art that includes email received  by the author, albeit written entirely by his correspondents, over a period of  time. Sociologically, <em>Inbox</em> is fascinating. It presents the highest  order of conceptual poetics just by being itself.<br />

<p>Gordon&rsquo;s work fuses the risky linguistics of language poetry  with a fresh, lyrical ambience that results in hyper-surrealistic prose poems.  Dense, clever, and unpredictable, his paragraphs shape sequences that bend and  twist toward a visionary apocalypse, whose music levitates the form and  presents new ways of reading it. This young writer has given us a compelling  book that should not disappear in the current prosperity of the genre.<br />  <strong>--Ray  Gonz&aacute;lez<em>, The Bloomsbury Review</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In the shatter of  each successive frame of reference, we hear amassing a sensually pitched cycle  of resonances, which enlarge our receptivity to the physical, the phenomenal  properties of language, and which engage in relational patterning beyond the  confines of logic and the trajectories we expect meaning to follow. Such an  &ldquo;area of sound&rdquo; tests the mind&rsquo;s resources, but in so doing enlarges our own  adaptive capacity to use language to press the parameters of reality in which  we dwell.<br />--<strong>Rusty Morrison, <em>Traffic</em></strong></p>
<p>These sounds trail us, press up against us and leave us  questioning the made world.<br />  <strong>--<em>Bookslut</em></strong></p>
<p>The poems both grapple and blend  with the white noise of technology surrounding them, so that you do not read  the lines so much as tune in to them.<br />  <strong>--<em>NewPages</em></strong></p>
<p>Gestures of resistance to  hegemony in Gordon&rsquo;s work utilize parody, flirt with aphorism, but richly  refuse simple prescription.<br />  <strong>--Thomas Fink, <em>Octopus  Magazine</em></strong></p>

<p>&hellip;Gordon&rsquo;s language&hellip;is rich and compelling&hellip;<br />--<strong>Airen McNally, <em>Rain Taxi</em></strong></p>
<p>&hellip;musical and literary all at once.<br />--<strong>Glen C. Silva, <em>Xantippe</em></strong></p>
<p>&hellip;the delightfully sudden clang of elusive, at times insanely  surreal trope-clusters&hellip; punctuate[s] many sections of <em>The Frequencies</em>.<br />--<strong>Thomas Fink, <em>Jacket Magazine</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&hellip;The Frequencies</em> is at times closer to the emails of  a brilliant auto-didactic gas attendant than to anything that announces itself  as poetry.&nbsp; That may be why it feels so alive.&nbsp; Most of the sparks  (there's a lot of sparks) come from watching Gordon work on the border between  how poets and actual people write; instead of condescendingly dropping slang  words and such into well-worn poetic structures, Gordon commits to the  structures of common discourse and finds something human and breathless there.<br />
