title: Noah Eli Gordon : Scorched Anecdote 


---
 
<h1>Scorched  Anecdote </h1>
<p>What begins an accrual of weak electric impulses<br />ends as scales practiced on the library steps</p>
<p>Notes rise. Days rise. I rise, then Sara rises<br />The carpenter bee understands nothing of helicopters<br />  The helicopter pilot understands bees perfectly</p>
<p>Salvage from declaratives vulnerability<br />Salvage Monica from Travis, Eric from Juliette <br />  From Mike salvage Julie &amp; Sara from me</p>
<p>Lettuce on paper, blackberry juice on the words: <br />
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re this &amp; we&rsquo;re that aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
