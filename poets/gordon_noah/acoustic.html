title: Noah Eli Gordon : An Acoustic Experience 


---
 
<h1>An Acoustic Experience </h1>
<p>Inoculate with ones &amp; zeros <br />the sound of the human voice</p>
<p>You have a computer&rsquo;s unrequited compassion<br />&amp; I, the outline of an ostrich <br />  torn in half, tacked to a pixilated heart</p>
<p>The perfect companion&rsquo;s a photograph of sand</p>
<p>Unexpanding, elegant universe<br />something something something the end</p>
