              <h1>&ldquo;All Orange Blossoms Have to Do is Act Naturally&rdquo;</h1>
              <p>And all the sky does is wait  around for weather to consume it. <br />
                Although, one could argue that  it&rsquo;s simply an extension of itself, <br />
                that one form describes another  in the sails of outrigger canoes <br />
                before a landward breeze blows  them toward the Philippine coast.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                If I stand still long enough,  the painting will go on without me. <br />
                Forget the mechanics of  rainfall; Plutarch said it was war caused <br />
                a cloudburst. I say the only  thing in the air is an evolving suspicion <br />
          that the laws of the atmosphere  have accumulated out of a desire </p>
              <p>to turn judiciousness on top of  its Draconian head, reclaiming <br />
                sound judgment from the silver  gavel affixed to our internalized sense <br />
                of fanciful reasoning taken for  fact. All Galileo does is build a thermometer <br />
          and immediately&mdash;you believe  him. Trade winds and doldrums in the tropics.</p>
              <p>Delicate mobility in the deer.  I love the tiny molecules that make up matter, <br />
                the tinier atoms inside them.  If I stand still long enough, someone will walk around me. </p>
