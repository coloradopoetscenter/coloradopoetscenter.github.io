<h1>Four Allusive Fields</h1>
<p>Who  is Cy Twombly? What is it he does? <br />And  what are we to call what he does?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Roland  Barthes</p>
<p>Cy listens absently to absent Homer <br />&amp; his refusal become a dead thing full of music<br />Smash it on a cyclotron. Drag it across a dozen centuries <br />Drips are old. Smudges are old. Talking a museum<br />out of its eternal monologue, it&rsquo;s not embarrassing <br />to leak in waves &amp; cones. Nudes fall from newspapers <br />as you fell from an oily twilight, from a painting<br />of the word twilight, arranged without letters, inkless<br />like a fire that consumes all before it, or better, inkless <br />as the phrase: &ldquo;like a fire that consumes all before it&rdquo;<br />Who wouldn&rsquo;t be mayor of a worked-over surface <br />returning clutter for a broom, ever-after for Cliffs Notes<br />Work smudging talk; talk smudging work <br />  Obedience is an awful word I think to get lost in</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Cy listens absently to absent Homer <br />explaining himself away. Boring as a canvas<br />to a waterfall, as a splotch of red to equations<br />lifting a helicopter, injured by a display of attentiveness<br />can you believe this humming anonymous light <br />The light is anonymity. Break it against <br />an electron, smear it with a magpie&rsquo;s <br />greenish black tail feather, cast it on a sheet <br />of orange vellum pasted inside a brown leather book <br />A cricket&rsquo;s ankle is not fragile to the cricket<br />Dab it there. It has nothing to do with the sun <br />The sun is a system free from authority <br />&amp; you sweet shy Achilles have already worn <br />  through your shoes &amp; the pedestal beneath</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Cy listens absently to absent Homer <br />taking notes that amount to nothing, &amp; nothing <br />erases as well as a name. Can one draw a careless world <br />out of its engorged abdomen? Ask that moth <br />eating through a painted magpie what grinding <br />against a shard of twilight gave it. Flowers <br />chalked over aluminum &amp; the elegance <br />of taped-on wings. Ladders reaching the roof <br />behind rain clouds brushed on to cover a mistake <br />Who wouldn&rsquo;t mistake the surface for vapid paint<br />a cloud for a sarcophagus a bed for a life your white shirt <br />for mine, blue for blue. Depending on the vantage point <br />proves you hang from it in pieces, &amp; though we hadn&rsquo;t <br />  arrived on the same boat, we&rsquo;re surely on the same boat now</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Cy listens absently to absent Homer <br />regards a useless allegory spreading its human shape <br />across inaudible dirt. Sparse, porous, scattered<br />any moment&rsquo;s fringe epicenter is irredeemably stalling<br />&amp; you move away like a building or a horse<br />The useless allegory adheres to logic, the first principle <br />of representation: if you walk to the bridge &amp; refuse  the view<br />clouds of blue steam still billow from a grate <br />below a green dumpster. Ask grime on a limbless statue <br />surrounded by tulips in May &amp; hope for an end to winter<br />who doesn&rsquo;t age absently ignoring unhinged flesh <br />Nakedness is a carriage &amp; I&rsquo;m in love with impossibility <br />for its dynamic body.&nbsp;  A shard of twilight smashed <br />  on the cyclotron. If you can see the fibers don&rsquo;t say so</p>
