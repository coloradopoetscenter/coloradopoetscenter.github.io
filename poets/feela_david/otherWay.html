<h1>The Other Way </h1>
<p>Beneath  the stone I found a pale universe,<br />the  cool, almost brittle shell of the earth <br />turned  on its back.&nbsp; I watched a hundred  creatures<br />scatter  like so many pieces of starlight<br />as a  universe expands, and so to better understand,<br />  I  propped the heavy stone, refused to let it fall back.</p>
<p>Beneath  the earth where my shovel first cut its path<br />I  opened a doorway into a cold hallway<br />  where  time had been pressed, then broken apart.</p>
<p>Beneath  the dirt I found a white whispering root<br />that  wound along a rotted stream.<br />I  wondered how it knew any direction <br />  beside  the one that told all things to go deep.</p>
<p>Beneath  the root I saw a lamp shining,<br />the  kind of light only an earthworm follows.<br />Pebbles  leaned toward the strange light, <br />and  the thick old bone of a skull <br />that  had long since abandoned its usual thinking <br />  stared  in the same direction.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And  like the instinct that a compass knows,<br />the  darkness seemed to turn of its own volition,<br />  to  take a reading, and continue on its long way down.</p>
