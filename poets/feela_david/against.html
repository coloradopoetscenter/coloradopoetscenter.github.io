          <h1>Against the Piedra</h1>
              <p>Before I left home for the Piedra River I packed</p>
              <p>a dozen nonessential things, like a winter hat,</p>
              <p>a dictionary, two pounds of roofing nails</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>and a ping-pong paddle. It was blazing summer</p>
              <p>and I needed a feeling of luxury, of being</p>
              <p>on my own with everything to lose.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I parked the car behind a convenience store</p>
              <p>where the highway touches a forest</p>
              <p>service road, and followed a trail sign</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>dividing a crooked path. One way climbed</p>
              <p>then flattened above the river, sixteen miles</p>
              <p>with a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the shining worm below;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>the other way tumbled like a stone to the river&rsquo;s edge,</p>
              <p>scrambled over river rock and through every root-tangle</p>
              <p>where the cottonwoods crowded together.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I must have carried sixty pounds, food</p>
              <p>enough for a monastery, my foolishness</p>
              <p>strapped to my back, and I began descending</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>like water tipped from a pitcher, like Dante</p>
              <p>refreshed by a cool draft on his way</p>
              <p>through a strange wood. I met not a soul</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>except the possibility of my own, then found myself</p>
              <p>standing toe to toe with a hundred feet of the Piedra.</p>
              <p>If this were hell it would be bone cold,</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>white spittle boiling over the bank, the river</p>
              <p>twisting itself into a cable, as if to pull</p>
              <p>an enormous boulder that glistened like the cusp</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>of a tooth. My shoulders ached, my heart sounded</p>
              <p>a drum from some deeper place </p>
              <p>where I had yet to descend. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
