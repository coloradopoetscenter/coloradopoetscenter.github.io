<h1>Dreaming at 11,000 Feet </h1>
<p>Up  here clouds can pass <br />through  a tent like balloons<br />balanced  above a cartoon character&rsquo;s head.<br />I  could be talking in my sleep<br />and  the words might escape,<br />drift  across the mountain&rsquo;s meadow<br />soundless  as a somber bear<br />or  they might catch on one of those scruffy<br />desperate  trees rooted at the timber line--<br />hanging  on,<br />twisted  like a wisp of ribbon<br />up  where it doesn&rsquo;t belong.<br />I  am asleep in the thin air<br />dreaming  of fire<br />that  sputters like a candle&rsquo;s wick.<br />My  heart gushes blood<br />so  that I can hear it all night<br />polishing  my bones.<br />If  I wake before I die<br />I  pray for at least one more <br />  glimpse  of this heaven.</p>
