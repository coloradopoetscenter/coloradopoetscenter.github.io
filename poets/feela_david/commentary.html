            <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          <p><i>&quot;David Feela&rsquo;s poems speak with a sort of ironic voice that allows a range of emotions...They are as unpredictable as the world we face and so are a wonderful knowing reflection of it.&quot;</i></p>
            <p><i><b></b></i>&ndash;Richard Jackson, author of <U>Dismantling Time </U>(U of Alabama)</p>
            <p><i>&quot;They (the poems) are the work of a bemused philosopher and humorist whose explorations of some historical moments create memorable images and revelations...They reveal with a gentle touch and considerable intelligence a lot about who we are and where we&rsquo;re going.&quot;</i></p>
            <p><i><b></b></i>&ndash;Leslie Ullman, author of <U>Slow Work Through Sand</U> (Iowa Prize, &lsquo;98)</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;What I have always loved about David Feela&rsquo;s poetry  is its distinctive blend of solemnity and wit, and the poems in The Home Atlas  offer this and more. Whether it&rsquo;s Petrarch, Mother Teresa, or his own mother,  writing letters about the weather, Feela&rsquo;s compass steers him clean to each  poem&rsquo;s immaculate heart. &lsquo;Places invent their language,&rsquo; the poet tells us.  David Feela unwraps language&rsquo;s possibilities and offers them as   
              precise and perfect gifts.&rdquo;&mdash;Lisa Lenard-Cook, author  of <em>Dissonance, Coyote Morning, </em>and <em>The Mind of Your Story </em></p>
            <p>&ldquo;David Feela is the voice of a voyager, but one who  turns his caring and   
              keen traveler&rsquo;s eyes on the landscape of home and  family. <em>The Home </em>  
  <em>Atlas</em> a wilderness guide for each  of us on own terri&#64257;c yet close-at-hand   
              adventures, right here, right now, where ever we  might be, on our own  
              voyages of the heart.&rdquo;&mdash;Ken Wright, author of <em>The Monkey Wrench </em>  
  <em>Dad</em> and <em>Why I'm Against It All </em></p>
            <p>&ldquo;David Feela&rsquo;s poems speak with a sort of ironic  voice that allows a   
              range of emotions from the tender to the tough, from  the comic to the   
              tragic, and with rare intelligence. They are as  unpredictable as the world   
              we face and so are a wonderful and knowing re&#64258;ection  of it, and more,   
              they discover what we didn&rsquo;t know before, the rare  vision that this   
              stunning new poet brings to that world.&rdquo;&mdash;Richard  Jackson, author of   
  <em>Part of the  Story, Worlds Apart, Alive All Day, </em>and<em> Heartwall</em></p>
            <p>&ldquo;These poems are the work of a bemused philosopher  and humorist   
              whose explorations of some historical moments create  memorable   
              images and revelations. These are poems I would like  to send into space   
              for other beings to decode because they reveal with  a gentle touch and   
              considerable intelligence a lot about  
  &nbsp;who we are  and where we are   
              going.&rdquo;&mdash;Leslie Ullman, author of <em>Natural Histories, Dreams by No One&rsquo;s </em>  
  <em>Daughter, </em>and<em> Slow Work Through Sand </em></p>
          <p>&ldquo;Feela is a master of the transcendent quotidian. He  shapes life&rsquo;s little   
              moments into brilliant epiphanies of light and grace  and unfailing good   
              humor. His &#64258;ourish of language prizes the  accessible, the simple, while   
              always injecting a wry twist of compassion, not  cynicism. Use these   
              poems like get-out-of-jail-free cards. No-sit  meditations. They will take   
              you past gaming, past lies, into the deep heart of  the mystery.&rdquo;&mdash;Art   
              Goodtimes, author of <em>As If the World Really Mattered</em></p>
