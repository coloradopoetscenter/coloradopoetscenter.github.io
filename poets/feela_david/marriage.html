          <h1>A Marriage Therapist Discusses Adam &amp; Eve</h1>
              <p>Her initial complaint </p>
              <p>was based on a lack of choice,</p>
              <p>a resentment she harbored</p>
              <p>until the day she died.</p>
              <p>Adam, after all, was </p>
              <p>the only available man.</p>
              <p>She took him for better</p>
              <p>but felt she got all the worse.</p>
              <p>He didn&rsquo;t share her grievance.</p>
              <p>In fact, he couldn&rsquo;t believe his luck.</p>
              <p>He awoke from a nap</p>
              <p>to find his first woman </p>
              <p>naked and toting lunch. </p>
              <p>Naturally, Adam wasn&rsquo;t perfect</p>
              <p>but he went on and on </p>
              <p>about the snake, </p>
              <p>as if Eve was the cold-blooded one.</p>
              <p>And truth be told,</p>
              <p>Eve liked the snake, </p>
              <p>maybe even better than Adam.</p>
              <p>Thought it at least understood </p>
              <p>how to have a conversation.</p>
              <p>In the end, of course, it was</p>
              <p>a beginning.</p>
              <p>The two reconciled, had kids,</p>
              <p>even went into business together:</p>
              <p>Paradise Tours. </p>
              <p>All their customers wanted to buy</p>
              <p>a few acres and build</p>
              <p>but in Eden the covenants were explicit: </p>
              <p>no people. </p>
