<h1>Our best  behavior </h1>
<p>We  do not kill children<br />(intentionally)<br />or  torture and rape their mothers.<br />We  do not loot<br />after  destroying a family&rsquo;s home.<br />If  offered a bribe<br />we  report it.<br />When  humanitarian aid drops from the sky<br />we  give the old people a chance<br />to  drag it away.<br />Holidays  are observed<br />and  holy days tolerated.<br />If  a child picks a flower<br />from  a field of rubble<br />we  snap a photo<br />and  send it to Washington.<br />Rules  of engagement <br />prohibit  bombing cemeteries<br />  while  the enemy&rsquo;s funeral is in progress.</p>
