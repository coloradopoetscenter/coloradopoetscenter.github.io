<h1>Shoulder Season</h1>
<p>Signs on shop doors read<br />Open weekends only<br /><em>See you at  Thanksgiving</em><br />  <em>Closing at 6:00 p.m.</em><br />It&rsquo;s the time of year<br />when the body of tourists <br />shrugs away from Main Street,<br />when the strong arms of merchants<br />  take a temporary rest.</p>
<p>Gray and golden, the days grow <br />shorter, begin and end in shadow,<br />and the white-topped mountains<br />draw their cloaks around town,<br />  like ragged scarecrows or ghosts.</p>
<p>We locals can find parking places<br />on any street and traffic wanes<br />on Highway 550.&nbsp; At  the roadside<br />  deer stand watching us in familiar groups.</p>
<p>Inside our houses, we sigh deep,<br />breathe slower,&nbsp; read  thicker<br />books and try out recipes <br />for soup we simmer on little-used <br />back burners.&nbsp; Down  our backs<br />the weight of the year <br />  begins to ease.</p>
