<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p> &ldquo;In this new collection, Beth Paulson&rsquo;s proficiency in the craft of poetry shines—whether in free verse or in form. This poet has her finger firmly on the pulse of nature—and human nature. With nods to Kinnell, Millay, Rumi, Whitman and others, <em>Canyon Notes</em> is intriguing, moving, and intelligent.&rdquo;<br /> Cynthia Brackett-Vincent, Publisher/Editor the <em>Aurorean.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;In her latest collection, <em>Canyon Notes</em>, Beth Paulson spills enthralling words and unexpected images that repeatedly strike the eye and resonate chords deep in the reader&rsquo;s imagination.&rdquo;  <br />Mark Todd, Western State Colorado University</p>  <p>&quot;<em>Wild Raspberries</em> is a poetry of plain talk with images from the countryside and family  life.&nbsp; Crisp and clear, these poems by Beth Paulson often have the feeling  of haiku.&nbsp; Their task is truly 'seeing' the world, a world far from cities  and today's turmoil, for their author seeks respite in reflection on  nature.&nbsp; An epigraph that opens one poem, 'A poem is a walk' (A. R. Ammons)  expresses the books' philosophy as the poet invites us to join her in seeking  the 'comfort of stones; and the lessons of the fox.&quot;<br />
-  Mary Crow, Former  Colorado Poet Laureate</p>  <p>&quot;Beth Paulson's poems are a kind of stillness, a  quietly examined life in lines as clear as a mountain stream.&nbsp; 'How will  we be changed?' she asks at one point. 'Will the world?'&nbsp; This welcome  collection is her earned reply.&rdquo;<br /> - David Mason,  Professor English, The Colorado College</p>
