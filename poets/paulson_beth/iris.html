<h1>Iris</h1>
<p>The iris are holding up their candles<br />of purple,&nbsp; blue and  white<br />and waking up the garden another year.<br />In awe, the deer forego them,<br />preferring new-green leaves <br />  of oaks to their sweet scent. </p>
<p>If you look close at one you can see<br />how its petals, soft and curvilinear,<br />enclose little yellow altars,<br />  how each flower is a tabernacle. </p>
<p>And after hard-fisted wind or long<br />ropes of rain move through the valley,<br />the iris stand like towers, shining<br />  and even more beautiful.</p>
<p>All my life I wished for certainty,<br />for the dependability of deep roots<br />to sustain me, and the world said<br /><em>Wait, Wait, Wait.</em></p>
