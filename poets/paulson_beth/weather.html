<h1>Weather at 12,000 Feet</h1>
<p>We found the lake called Columbine,<br />blue glacial bowl, sky-lightened for a time,<br />  and seeing it gave us hope enough</p>
<p>to locate and retrace prints our boots made <br />almost erased by falling snow.<br />  One of us talked about his recent divorce--</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d missed signs, too&mdash;then hadn&rsquo;t the power <br />to stop.&nbsp; A rock  unloosed goes its own way <br />  until it comes to rest in a new place </p>
<p>such as that high, hummocked basin <br />we crossed, snow veiling the drab remains <br />of wind-bent summer flowers <br />  as the whole sky turned metallic. </p>
<p>When thunder struck, we dropped our poles<br />onto the skree, watched pikas flee <br />  to rocky dens,&nbsp; felt  hands and faces chill. </p>
<p>We put on every layer in our packs <br />and, leaning together against one taller crag,<br />  opened up a map to check the route, then</p>
<p>ate a few bites of wet lunch, ice <br />on the lips of water bottles.&nbsp; Guidebooks say<br />  to pack warm hats, gloves, jackets, socks, </p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t pay what&rsquo;s close enough attention,<br />don&rsquo;t always stay alert for sudden shifts <br />or warnings like we saw on the way up--<br />  gropple that was already dropping thick.</p>
