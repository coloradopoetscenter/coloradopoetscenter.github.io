  <h1>Biography</h1>  <p>C. E. Greer grew up in the Fort Collins area and  lives now near Wellington. He earned degrees from Dartmouth College and the  University of Washington. A major theme of his poetry explores the human place  in nature, the same question his work on university faculties in Texas and  Indiana considered from a blend of physical science and social science  perspectives. His two chapbooks, <em>Wild  Plums</em> and <em>No Famous Place</em>, are  both from Pudding House Publications, 2010. He is co-editor of two anthologies:&nbsp;&quot;<em>Say This of Horses:&nbsp;A Selection of  Poems</em>&rdquo; from University of Iowa Press, 2007, and &quot;<em>And Know This Place: Poetry of Indiana</em>,&quot; forthcoming from  Indiana Historical Society Press in 2011.</p>
