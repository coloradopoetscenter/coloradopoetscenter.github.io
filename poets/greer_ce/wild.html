          <h1>Wild Plums</h1>
          <p>The  bushes grow halfway up<br />
            the  sage and short grass bank<br />
            where  we pulled over one hot day<br />
            and  got out to stand by the pickup<br />
            with  the long curve of the river<br />
            running  below,</p>
          <p>stand  and pick the pink-orange fruit<br />
            hanging  so thick we’d seen it<br />
            from  the road and my father told me<br />
            to  stop—some still sour and some<br />
            with  a delicate sweetness beginning<br />
            to  change the sour. We ate and made<br />
            a  pile on the seat between us for mother<br />
            who  couldn't leave the house any more.</p>
          <p>He  said in sixty years up and down<br />
            that  road he'd never stopped, though<br />
            the  bushes often bore a heavy crop.<br />
            Now  I see them every year, driving alone,<br />
            but  haven't stopped since that last day<br />
            he  and I came out of the canyon<br />
            in  level sun of August afternoon<br />
            and  crossed the open valley home.          </p>
