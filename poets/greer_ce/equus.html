  <h1>Equus</h1>  <p>When afternoon begins  dissolving,<br /> I take Spud and Snook to  pasture,<br /> each on a lead, with me  between,<br /> both roiling energy, to burst<br /> at the gate and pound up the  field<br /> with flanks hard and eyes  high,<br /> daring any challenge to their  fleet<br /> dominion of that grassy  world.</p>  <p>But there is a moment before  the gate <br /> where our way narrows between<br /> rank cedars and dogwood by  the lane,<br /> when their nimble urgency not  to be last <br /> through that tapering speeds  them,<br /> and I must keep my feet safe<br /> from theirs, my elbows high,</p>  <p>so as they surge<br /> the crowding will lift and  carry me—<br /> so three rib cages crush and  drive<br /> in one flow, three backs weld  <br /> to rock as one and I am part<br /> of the deep charge against  all fettering,<br /> of shoulders churning like  boulders<br /> in a flood to deliver us</p>  <p>hoof-drumming ancient plains<br /> with sun and new stems waving<br /> belly high, so we can keep<br /> with distance this heart safe<br /> from what would creep against<br /> our swifting over the globe— </p>  <p>all of this in a few strides<br /> before the cedars are behind,<br /> Spud and Snook ballet wider,<br /> and with feet on the ground  now<br /> at the gate, I loosen their  leads <br /> and we stream apart</p>  <p>to know again the separate  sky,<br /> the close clothing of breeze, <br /> to feel again so sharp the  green<br /> and beckoning of grass. </p>  <p>C.E. Greer<br /> (<em>Wind, </em>Spring,  2002)</p>
