  <h1>Ilha Formosa</h1>  <p>An island over the  ocean west,<br /> and my teacher,  showing old ways,<br /> said, <em>eat  nothing but fresh papaya</em>;<br /> and so I did, three  times a day—<br /> all I wanted, firm  and sweet,<br /> with only lime to  boost <br /> the clean, wide  taste.</p>  <p>Papaya piled like  fish<br /> at market stalls—plump<br /> and succulent  treat,<br /> though the best  never left<br /> a tangled  mountain's feet—<br /> kept there by a  village man<br /> who offered them  from his trees.</p>  <p>Past the last bus  stop I'd walk<br /> to his hut and  trade for fruit,<br /> then sit in the  shade to eat,</p>  <p>and that let me  forget<br /> about food—to know  new paths:<br /> behind the village  hiking big noons<br /> sheened white over  all a mountain-<br /> side of breathing  green, quick<br /> snakes striving  full so hot<br /> a heaven of leaves,</p>  <p>so back here now<br /> I know about  walking away<br /> again—south this  time perhaps,<br /> where papaya began<br /> when seasons were  time<br /> and no trees sailed  yet<br /> for Goa, Manila,  Macao,</p>  <p>or for that island<br /> where surely now<br /> a man will be at  his hut<br /> with new fruit<br /> and the folds of a  mountain<br /> opening down,<br /> profligate with green.</p>  <p>C.E.
