  <h1>In Badlands</h1>  <p>After I shot the deer<br /> and it fell on a rough ledge,<br /> ancient prayers of thanks<br /> to my father flooded out of  me.<br /> Then I climbed to the ledge<br /> and spoke soft words to the  deer.</p>  <p>A sound from the last  shifting of blood<br /> or breath inside its ribs let  me understand<br /> how such a noise may come  from my chest <br /> for someone else to hear—at a  highway<br /> accident perhaps, or in the  careful bed<br /> of a quiet room.</p>  <p>But it might be out on the  land<br /> where trees or grass stems  stand<br /> against the sky, or at a  place like this<br /> with only the open earth and  spilling air,<br /> only the high, clean light.</p>  <p>C.E. Greer</p>  <p>(<em>Sin Fronteras Journal</em>,  14 Spring, 2010)  </p>
