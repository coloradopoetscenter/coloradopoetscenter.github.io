  <h1>Demolition Derby</h1>  <p>Gray skies and the stars and stripes <br /> hang above this rodeo arena<br /> two feet deep with Missouri Ozark mud. <br /> The bombs of our latest war started  falling today,<br /> but here, station wagons and giant  sedans<br /> bellow and smoke and sling a shrapnel of  mud.<br /> We watch from lawn chairs on a rise<br /> between the arena and a railroad line<br /> where freights rumble past and shake the  sumac<br /> reddening along the tracks.<br /><em>This is what we fight  for</em>,  the announcer says,<br /> as the last two cars face off, a  dogfight, <br />  each driver aiming to be the last one  running.</p>  <p>The Chrysler has avoided crippling hits<br /> in every heat and lunges through the  muck<br /> with a race engine snarl.  The Number Seven car<br /> is a yellow wreck so mangled<br /> that the make is anybody’s guess,<br /> and soon the Chrysler plows that yellow  hood <br /> up into the driver’s line of sight.<br /> But Seven charges forward, back and  forward,<br /> throwing his heap against an opponent<br /> who has him outmuscled and blind. </p>  <p>He lurches against the Chrysler, hissing <br /> sugary coolant, crankshaft bearings  knocking,<br /> fan sparking against the radiator,<br /> but out to show what he can do<br /> with tools and junk, the skin of his  knuckles,<br /> a month of Sundays and a little bit of  nerve.<br /> This is what we fight for.<br /> The spectators are up, shouting,<br /> or shaking their heads as they would<br /> at having to put an old bull down,<br /> and the Chrysler deals a final running  blow <br /> that leaves the Seven car stalled and  smoking.</p>  <p>(First published in <em>Poet Lore)</em><strong> </strong></p>
