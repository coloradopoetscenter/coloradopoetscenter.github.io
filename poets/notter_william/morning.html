          <h1>Morning News in the  Big Horn Mountains</h1>
          <p>The latest movie star is drunk just out  of rehab,<br />
            two or three cities had extraordinary  killings,<br />
            and expensive homes are sliding off the  hills<br />
            or burning again.  There’s an energy crisis on,<br />
            and peace in the Middle East is close as  ever.<br />
            In Wyoming, just below timberline, <br />
            meteors and lightning storms<br />
            keep us entertained at night.  Last week,<br />
            a squirrel wrecked the mountain  bluebirds’ nest.  <br />
            I swatted handfuls of moths in the cabin <br />
            and set them on a stump each day, <br />
            but the birds would not come back to  feed.<br />
            It snowed last in June, four inches<br />
            the day before the solstice.  But summer<br />
            is winding down—frost on the grass <br />
            this morning when we left the ranger  station. <br />
            Yellow-bellied marmots are burrowing<br />
            under the outhouse vault, and ravens  leave the ridges<br />
            to gorge on Mormon crickets in the  meadows.<br />
            Flakes of obsidian and red flint<br />
            knapped from arrowheads hundreds of  years ago <br />
            appear in the trails each day,<br />
            and the big fish fossil in the limestone  cliff<br />
          dissolves a little more with every rain.</p>
