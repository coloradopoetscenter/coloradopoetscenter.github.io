  <h1>Directions in the  Nebraska Sandhills</h1>  <p>In the wind-flaked town of Lakeside,<br /> I find two boys with a bow and arrows<br /> shooting at starlings in the elms.<br /> When I ask if the Lodgepole road is  paved,<br /> they stare as if I’d spoken Spanish.<br /> But the short one cocks his tractor cap<br /> and says the road is all caliche,<br />  that I’d better go through Alliance.</p>  <p>With long hair and a ramshackle car<br /> I must look like the drug-fiend crazies<br /> their parents tell them about.<br /> I want to tell them how lucky they are<br /> to live in Nebraska’s emptiest county.<br /> Ahead of them are shotguns, pheasant,<br /> deer from groves along the Platte.<br /> Then clumsiness with girls, the monotony <br /> of tractors, raking hay.  They will hate Lakeside.<br /> They will buy a pickup or souped-up car,<br /> rumble off to Rapid City, Denver,  anywhere.</p>  <p>When they find a place without wind<br /> the air will feel like dirty clothes.<br /> They will find country filled with  trees,<br /> but dream horizons.  They will miss<br /> the smell of alfalfa glistening at dawn.<br /> In mountains they will wish for sunset<br /> the way it looks past Alliance, nothing<br /> but orange sky over all their families  work for,<br /> ponds like sheets of Depression glass,<br /> trill of a fencepost meadowlark, <br /> Angus in silhouette, more space<br /> than anyone can stand until he leaves.</p>  <p>(First  published in the Chester H. Jones Foundation 1999 Poetry Competition Winners  Anthology)</p>
