<h1>Thoughts upon  Dating a Tyrannosaurus Rex </h1>
<p>I thought your kind were extinct:<br />You appeared on the scene and all<br />Cretaceous creatures scattered.<br />Surprising: the soft, sad voice<br />and loneliness behind the roar.<br />Yet I trembled, unearthed.<br />Who could blame me?<br />Four feet of skull, so heavy to carry  erect!<br />Rapacious hunger brewed tempers to  roll<br />heads bloody, but never mine.&nbsp; Yet<br />you learned the human language, the  credos <br />of our time. When you formed<br />my name, all instinct<br />bade me follow. And when <br />your talons penetrated my <br />soft flesh, I swear<br />the whole Jurassic <br />rose up and screamed. How<br />your terrific frame<br />diminished: how incongruous our fit.<br />I leaned the lily <br />of my ear against the brown scales<br />near sacral ribs,<br />and heard the palpitations of doubt:<br />the consciousness of a modern woman.<br />I was not trapped there in <br />  a tyranny of love.</p>
