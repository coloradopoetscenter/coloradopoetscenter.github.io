<h1 >Hornet</h1>
<p >I awake in swarms of sweat:<br />dreams of stingers plunging  again.<br />It seems a lifetime ago<br />my honey-body burst<br />through the white gauze  curtains<br />into dry fields of dust and  prey/<br />wet worlds buzzing with storms.<br />Another month, and I'll be  over.<br />Drunk with bile<br />you've chewed my flesh to pulp,<br />flown to another nest<br />  to populate that queen. </p>
