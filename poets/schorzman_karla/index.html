<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>I am a  quasi-traveled Colorado native, prodigal librarian, and instructor of creative  writing, composition, and sociology courses at several greater metro area  colleges. I currently lead the &ldquo;Alleged Poets Society&rdquo; for fellow faculty,  creative writing students, and serious lay writers.&nbsp; I also co-led the Ex Libris creative writers&rsquo;  group and exhibition committee at the University of Colorado&rsquo;s Norlin Library,  which organized public readings of such notable writers as Robert Bly and  Pamela Hadas.</p>
<p>My other  artistic endeavors include quilting and counted cross-stitch embroidery,  including a project which earned a blue ribbon in a local county fair (and a  whopping $8 cash prize) a couple of years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My written  creative work has appeared in various publications over the last twenty-five  years, including Colorado Department of Education/State Library statewide  newsletters/summer reading packets, <em>The</em> <em>Aims Review, Listen Light, and Beauty:  the Beast</em> (Anthology created in conjunction with a display and reading at  CU Boulder). I am now Faculty Chair for Front Range Community College, Brighton  Campus.</p>
