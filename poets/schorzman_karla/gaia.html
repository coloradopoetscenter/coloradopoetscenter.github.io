              <h1 >Gaia Woman</h1>
              <p >Her soul tenderly houses<br />
                The Seven Wonders of the World.<br />
                The Sphinx&rsquo;s tail twitches in  anticipation<br />
                of all oracles from the cave of her  mouth.<br />
                Her arms are recovered limbs<br />
                From the Venus de Milo.<br />
                Her nipples are almonds from <br />
                the tomb of Hatshepsut.<br />
                She&rsquo;s the Bathsheba of Jacuzzis,<br />
                Lady Godiva of the Steeplechase--<br />
                Helen of Troy launches her ships.<br />
                Her torso is an altar<br />
                To Quetzcotl, Christ, and Krishna<br />
                A monk&rsquo;s ring splices her nose<br />
                Her mucus is the Balm of Gilead<br />
                The down of her sex is gold filigree<br />
                Her lungs are bright cumulus clouds.<br />
                Her armpits sweat Holy Water<br />
                Her saliva is the Fountain of Youth,<br />
                Her excrement heals the lame.<br />
                Her ears ring with Liberty Bells<br />
                The soles of her feet are  lily pads<br />
          Brimming with kissable frogs</p>
              <p >Her vagina is Stonehenge<br />
                Magic, inscrutable<br />
                And oft&rsquo; visited.<br />
                Her fingers are lightning<br />
                Her neck, a silver sieve<br />
          In her purse are Dora&rsquo;s pills.</p>
              <p >Her eyes are like Burbank &ndash;<br />
                Neither quite Hollywood nor Disneyland<br />
                Her eyes are Taj Majals<br />
          Graves covered in splendor.</p>
              <p >Her scent is a cloying candle shop &ndash;<br />
                Potpourri, Georgio, and ash.<br />
                Inside the lantern of her spirit<br />
                Eight days of oil last but a moment.<br />
                Her speech is hay fever and honey --<br />
                Whatever happens to be in bloom.<br />
                Her chakras are unordered,<br />
                Inordinate, cymbals clanging<br />
          A tintinnabulation of impending doom.</p>
              <p >Her teeth are bits of poached ivory<br />
                Her nails are sapphires and rubies,  bruises<br />
                on slaves from King  Solomon&rsquo;s mines.<br />
                Her garments are embroidered<br />
                sweatshop silks from Myanmar<br />
                She steps as lightly as dawn<br />
                blazes down upon the hungry and the  lost<br />
                Her calves are sacred carved oaks<br />
                Chopped by Lizzie Borden&rsquo;s axe<br />
                Her breasts are named<br />
                Kilamanjaro and Krakotoa &ndash;<br />
                Prophesying death and war<br />
          Her wrists are severed hands from  Auschwitz.</p>
              <p >In her serpentine folds<br />
                She holds more twists than Chubby  Checker<br />
                Her buttocks are swarming anthills<br />
                Veined like maps<br />
                of blood, a mercurial topography  marking<br />
                my dowry at Earth&rsquo;s End:<br />
                for I be the dragon,<br />
          beware, these molten words of fire.</p>
