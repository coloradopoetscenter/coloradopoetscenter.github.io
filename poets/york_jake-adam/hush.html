              <h1>Hush </h1>
              <p>It&rsquo;s just the wind, she says, </p>
              <p> and not the cigarette pull </p>
              <p> of a stranger in the roadside weeds, </p>
              <p> the wind, and not the ember burrowing </p>
              <p> like a mite in a dead bird&rsquo;s wing </p>
              <p> or your fear that the weeds will catch </p>
              <p> and it won&rsquo;t be wind any more, </p>
              <p> the wind, and not the shadow </p>
              <p> blazing brush toward the few </p>
              <p> still-lit windows that glow </p>
              <p> like cigarette tips through the leaves, </p>
              <p> but the wind, the wind </p>
              <p> through his hair, his lungs, </p>
              <p> his easeful steps, quiet </p>
              <p> as the wind or the wisteria </p>
              <p> gripping the screen or the small boy </p>
              <p> running through the moonlit woods </p>
              <p> from the man who entered </p>
              <p> like the wind in his ears </p>
              <p> as the trellis bends </p>
              <p> to those open, hungry hands, </p>
              <p> or the maple shuddering at the screen </p>
              <p> where no one&rsquo;s home </p>
              <p> but the wind </p>
              <p> that watches itself fall </p>
              <p> to the man whose suit of flame </p>
              <p> crackles like the wind </p>
              <p> that comes through the screen </p>
              <p> like a mother saying </p>
              <p> hush it&rsquo;s only the wind, </p>
              <p> or a mother saying hush </p>
              <p> it&rsquo;s only the wind. </p>
