              <h1>Negatives
              </h1>
              <p><em>Townspeople gathered for the burning of John Lee. August 13, 1911 , Durant , Oklahoma . Gelatin silver print. Real photo postcard. 5&frac12; x 3&frac12;&rdquo; </em></p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> You cannot see the body </p>
              <p> each eye fixes, the focus </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> of the plume that angles every head, </p>
              <p> John Lee, curling skyward </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> from the fire, </p>
              <p> a town&rsquo;s worth of bullets </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> searing white in the char </p>
              <p> that was a man, gunned down </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> and set ablaze. John Lee </p>
              <p> will burn till sundown, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> till ash and <em>a few charred parcels</em>, </p>
              <p> till the crowd disbands and spreads </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> to the corners of the town </p>
              <p> now shut of every black, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> and poor Miss Campbell&rsquo;s <em>poor white soul</em></p>
              <p> drifts, <em>avenged</em>, to heaven </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> till the photographer bends to his film </p>
              <p> to darken the postcard caption, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> block letters that will blaze white </p>
              <p><em> COON COOKING</em> &mdash; the <em>barbecue</em></p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> one will later describe </p>
              <p> on the opposite side. But for now </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> you can see only smoke </p>
              <p> and the appetite on the faces </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> closest to the heat, </p>
              <p> the desperate arching of a body </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> eager for a glimpse of the gravity, </p>
              <p> the magnetism of this powerless man. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> But let us imagine </p>
              <p> just afterward, the camera slung </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> on the taker&rsquo;s shoulder, </p>
              <p> and at its heart a thousand blacks </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> staring into this cloud of light, </p>
              <p> for a moment neither </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> gathering toward nor </p>
              <p> descending from heaven, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> but waiting in their adoration </p>
              <p> and blessing each with its glow &mdash; </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> a vision of these thousand whites </p>
              <p> turned dark for an hour </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> and praying, terrified, to this pillar </p>
              <p> for the rectifying light </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> and then imagine, </p>
              <p> their prayer, the paper </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> slowly darkening in the light </p>
              <p> until they are restored, white from dark, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> but the cloud now a dark tornado </p>
              <p> caught on the verge of breaking through, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> ready to consume each watcher </p>
              <p> until all there is is this plume, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> the body enlarged, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> its ash, a thousand postcards </p>
              <p> of a world he dared not dream he dreamed, </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> signed with the names of all who watch, </p>
              <p> ready to inscribe the scene </p>
              <p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
              <p><em> Wish you were here. </em></p>
