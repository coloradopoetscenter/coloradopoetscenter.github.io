              <h1>York</h1>
              <p> &mdash; &ldquo;here all the party of Sergt. Pryors joined us except my man York, who had stopped to rite his load and missed his way&rdquo; </p>
              <p> &mdash; William Clark, 7 Dec 1805 </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> So different with this name, </p>
              <p> before, tied to them who depended </p>
              <p> on your skill, your speed </p>
              <p> through prairie-grass, your eye </p>
              <p> for foot and trail </p>
              <p> (passed down </p>
              <p> from the first to skip domain </p>
              <p> and lead a tracker deeper </p>
              <p> into losing you, reading land </p>
              <p> as you, then someone else, </p>
              <p> drawing what you needed </p>
              <p> then against your need) </p>
              <p> so acute </p>
              <p> at first they might have thought </p>
              <p> you inhuman, then human, more, </p>
              <p> the wood-sense you had </p>
              <p> by your hands they should have kissed </p>
              <p> and did at last by taking all the bands </p>
              <p> they could &ndash; already slipping them </p>
              <p> in the high, blue grasses of the mountains </p>
              <p> like water in a dry country, leaving </p>
              <p> the marks of leaving marks behind </p>
              <p> so good it seemed you were moving </p>
              <p> north and west. </p>
              <p> I wish </p>
              <p> I had <em>your</em> journals, </p>
              <p> that I could read </p>
              <p> and follow what I cannot see </p>
              <p> up this rock, this trail </p>
              <p> into that blank </p>
              <p> beyond what anyone could name. </p>
