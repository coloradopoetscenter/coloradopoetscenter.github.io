<h1>Walt Whitman in Alabama</h1>
<p> Maybe on his way to Gadsden , </p>
<p> Queen City of the Coosa , </p>
<p> to speak with the pilots and inland sailors, </p>
<p> to cross the fords Jackson ran with blood </p>
<p> or meet the mayor who </p>
<p> bought the ladies&rsquo; favors with river quartz, </p>
<p> maybe east from some trip west to see </p>
<p> or returning north from New Orleans </p>
<p> or just lost in those years after The War </p>
<p> as legend has it, after the bannings, </p>
<p> when he&rsquo;d grown tired of puffs and plates, </p>
<p> after he&rsquo;d grown the beard and begun </p>
<p> to catch things there he had to walk off </p>
<p> or sing unwritten, maybe when the open road </p>
<p> opened on mockingbirds two and two &mdash; </p>
<p> no one knows, though the stories have him here </p>
<p> recapturing Attalla, shaking poems from his hair </p>
<p> on the steps of local churches. Maybe </p>
<p> it was the end of many letters, the last </p>
<p> of hospital days, another sleight </p>
<p> to make his hand come alive </p>
<p> when he couldn&rsquo;t bring some Southron home. </p>
<p> I see him there remembering his poems, </p>
<p> his back to the door, singing </p>
<p> out to the garden of the world, </p>
<p> the tropical spring of pine and jasmine, </p>
<p> how wondrous it was the pent-up river </p>
<p> washed to green their farms, the creeks swole </p>
<p> with mountain dew to sprout the corn, </p>
<p> herbage of poke and collard, </p>
<p> spinach and bean, to wash the roots </p>
<p> of every leaf to come. But more </p>
<p> I wonder what he did not say, </p>
<p> whether the doors were closed on the room </p>
<p> where none thought Jesus ever naked, </p>
<p> whether he went down Gadsden &rsquo;s Broad </p>
<p> to the bluff where a hundred years thence </p>
<p> someone fabled a child lost from the arms </p>
<p> of his hispanic mother and almost saved </p>
<p> by a cop who brought from his pocket </p>
<p> a shirt&rsquo;s worth of proof before the woman </p>
<p> vanished with her English, before the psychics </p>
<p> started rowing down the channel </p>
<p> to listen for the baby&rsquo;s dreams &mdash; all years after </p>
<p> the whorehouses, the fires, Reconstruction </p>
<p> and true religion came, after Whitman said his piece </p>
<p> and left the county to its mayors, </p>
<p> its wars and local dramas, Broad Street </p>
<p> and its theatres to opening and closing </p>
<p> and being torn down to photograph and rumor </p>
<p> where Vaudeville variety traveled </p>
<p> in those years before the world became real </p>
<p> and history stilled, before the damns stalled </p>
<p> the yearly flood that washed the roots </p>
<p> and made new fields from catfish and shit </p>
<p> and the mountain dead, before </p>
<p> the sun in the tassels was wormed to shine, </p>
<p> before shine dried into the hills </p>
<p> with the snakes, the poetry, the legend. </p>
<p> I imagine him here in the different city, </p>
<p> bathing in the yellow light as the river slips </p>
<p> beneath the bridge, flickering like a candle </p>
<p> or like the body or like the bodies </p>
<p> lit up with gasoline and beer, tremble of taillights, </p>
<p> while the statue of the Civil War heroine </p>
<p> points fingerless down Broad, down the stream </p>
<p> of headlamps and embers of burning weed, </p>
<p> a congregation in which his secrets and his song </p>
<p> would be unwelcome, though he slake </p>
<p> some secret thirsts, his orotund voice </p>
<p> tune our ears to the river&rsquo;s whisper, </p>
<p> a baby cradled in branches </p>
<p> deep beneath the bridge. </p>
<p> Its ribs filter the Coosa &rsquo;s brown. </p>
<p> Its arms raise the crops. </p>
<p> And every night it whispers the town </p>
<p> in some new forgotten tongue.</p>
