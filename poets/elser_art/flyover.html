              <h1>Flyover Country </h1>
<p>From thirty thousand feet at night the glow <br/>
  of city lights from DC to Boston confounds. <br/>
  If each light represented only one person, <br/>
  the numbers would astound. Pack too many <br/>
  rats in a cage and they fight, kill, and eat <br/>
  each other. How do people thrive, jammed <br/>
  together like that? Why don't they go crazy? <br/>
  Violent? Perhaps that&rsquo;s why the evening news <br/>
in those cities is so messy. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather look down at flyover country, <br/>
  the braided North Platte, emerald green <br/>
  alfalfa circles, towns with grain elevators <br/>
  along the railroad, a thin road to an airstrip <br/>
  two miles out of town, ranches miles apart, <br/>
  a field half light, half dark, a tractor pulling <br/>
  the dark thread. Cattle gathered around <br/>
  a stock tank in a windmill&rsquo;s shadow. <br/>
  The fruitful work of man in nature.
