              <h1>A Villanelle of War </h1>
<p> The mortal soul is shattered by a war <br/>
  much like a body blown by bomb or shot, <br/>
  the pain recedes but never goes away. </p>
<p> The guilt remains because he could not save <br/>
  those men who died when he arrived too late, <br/>
  his mortal soul was shattered by the war. </p>
<p> His terror as the bullets passed his plane,  <br/>
  and snapped at him as if the jaws of death,  <br/>
  the fear recedes but never goes away.<br/>
<p> <br>
</p>
He often thinks of enemies he killed, <br/>
their mothers, wives, and children left to grieve, <br/>
their souls forever shattered by the war. </p>
<p> How can he ever clear that guilt or ask <br/>
  forgiveness from the men whose lives he took?<br/>
  The guilt recedes but never goes away. </p>
<p> He sees friends' bodies strewn in rice-green fields, <br/>
  and ghosts of men he killed in burning woods. <br/>
  His mortal soul is shattered by that war. <br/>
  The pain recedes but never goes away. </p>
