              <h1>Phoenix Rising from the Marsh </h1>
<p> The setting sun etches the blue-black <br/>
  ridge against a turquoise and coral sky. <br/>
  From the dark in the east comes the calls <br/>
  of sandhill cranes returning to the marsh. <br/>
  They become silent, set their wings, glide <br/>
  to smooth landings, and take a few steps <br/>
  to stretch graceful legs. </p>
<p> This morning, these same cranes flew <br/>
  from this marsh, rising like phoenixes <br/>
  from the ash and mud of the Cretaceous, <br/>
  the spirits of dinosaurs that died millions <br/>
  of years ago as that era ended. They lifted <br/>
  slowly into the dawning sky, like Adam <br/>
  reaching to the hand of God in the Sistine. </p>
<p> A few weeks earlier, these cranes warbled <br/>
  high in a prairie morning into the sight <br/>
  of an old warrior walking there, looking <br/>
  for peace and solitude. He heard their calls, <br/>
  like the simple notes of a Beethoven adagio. <br/>
  His soul wanted to fly with the cranes. </p>
<p> As with emotions he felt in the Sistine Chapel <br/>
  or when he listened to the adagios of Mahler or <br/>
  Beethoven, he could find no words to express <br/>
  the joy he felt in their ancient music. </p>
