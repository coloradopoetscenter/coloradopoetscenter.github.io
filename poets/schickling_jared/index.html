          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>Jared Schickling received his BA in English and anthropology  from SUNY Buffalo in 2007.  He will  receive his MFA from Colorado State University in the spring of 2010 where he  teaches composition, facilitates undergraduate creative writing workshops, and  serves as the Assistant to the Director of the Creative Writing Reading  Series.  He hopes to teach at the college  or university level upon completion of his degree and is currently seeking this  employment.  His creative and academic  interests include the unlikely convergences of romantic, ecopoetic, and  postmodern/constructivist theory and concerns. </p>
