<h1>That Curve</h1>
<p>This roaring fear is excruciating but I must <br />get back to the coffee bar in concourse K, <br />as I head off beyond Chicago, beyond this day. <br />  From the vantage point inside this skyward</p>
<p>machine - I remember waking from last night&rsquo;s <br />restless dream. I pushed your biology books off <br />the bed and, reaching out for your skin, I found <br />  that curve where your hips begin. As my eyes </p>
<p>rolled back in my head, I caught a glimpse <br />that the first, the very first, slimy sea  creature<br />must have noticed as it crawled out <br />  of the water upon the stromatolitic new land</p>
<p>and was overwhelmed with many things. <br />The newness of it all, the heaviness of the  green, <br />the sky, the odor, but most of all <br />  the delicious possibilities of that curve,</p>
<p>that need, that urge to move up the beach, <br />into the green, and get together with others of  our <br />kind. The trilobites before and the giant  ammonoids<br />  washed upon the shore. Crustaceans tell the  story </p>
<p>dead in the shale. The shark and the whale. From <br />the curves of diplodocus to the Irish Elk&rsquo;s  ridiculous</p>
<p>antlers to you and me at O&rsquo;Hare on a snowy day, <br />having a cafe grande in concourse K. Gazing out</p>
<p>at the airport world: The conference of  employees,&nbsp; <br />what were they discussing? The de-icing <br />operations, the droning workers driving <br />  baggage carts. All the airplane monsters.</p>
<p>When a sassy-dressed redhead with loose<br />curves walked past with an older man in <br />nifty black leather, I leaned over and said to  you,<br />  This is biology. This is natural selection.</p>
<p>All of this... pulsating hallway, rotating  walkway,<br />elevating flyway, whirlwind window reflecting  round <br />plastic tables with styrofoam cups half full of<br />instinctual<br />green memory. All of this comes from that curve,<br />  that need, that urge to move up the beach.</p>
