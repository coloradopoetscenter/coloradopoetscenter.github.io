              <h1>Your African Fold</h1>
              <p>The sunrise in your gray eyes speaks <br />
                the history of man with no words.<br />
                Silence spirals across the sky.<br />
          This nautiloid look from the inside.</p>
              <p>Wrapped in saugins and duvet<br />
                with eyes wide tight against the sounds <br />
                outside, trembling at your footsteps<br />
                in the dawn moonlight. Africa,<br />
                I miss your naked eye <br />
                nebula, your pale chanting evenings,<br />
                the truth in your false cross.<br />
                I can still see the baboon stare<br />
                of your gravel highway I drove down <br />
                to fata morgana herself, <br />
                her moist finger motioning me to jump <br />
                from the cliffs of my unspoken east.<br />
                I can still hear the what what of your <br />
                quick click chit chat this that and the other, <br />
                tell me another story so hard from the start,<br />
                so far from home, sleeves on the heart.<br />
                The tragedy of the easy tip,<br />
                the comedy of the kitchen lip,<br />
                the opera of the landy stuck in the sandy<br />
                and old jack hiboy only knows one way to go.<br />
                Pull the damned thing out, sounds&nbsp; <br />
                Mr. Basso Profundo, unair these tires man,<br />
                get thee out of this godforsaken land.&nbsp; <br />
                Godforsaken? I don&rsquo;t think so.<br />
                Why here He comes just now, walking <br />
                through the shadow of a quiver tree,<br />
                out across the gravel plain.<br />
                Walking on one leg with one arm and one eye <br />
                that can still find the road ahead. Africa,<br />
                I&rsquo;ll sail through your lagoon anytime.<br />
                I&rsquo;ll paint butterflies in your sand all night  long. <br />
                I&rsquo;ll lay by your side as you die before your  time.<br />
          I&rsquo;ll see you rise again with Mimosa.</p>
              <p>Mimosa, I can still feel the bowl of your soft  dark 
                belly <br />
                hanging above me every night. Tucking me in, <br />
                rolling me over and over until I&rsquo;ve been rolled<br />
          into the arms of your African fold.</p>
