<h1>Do Not Run From Your Poet Self<br />
or No One Really Has To Know The Whole Story</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>~ for Billy Collins</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>do not fear your poet self</p>
<p>when you discover him under your life boat hiding</p>
<p>do not punish him like a pathetic stow away</p>
<p> </p>
<p>what he has to say</p>
<p>will not throw you overboard</p>
<p>he is you as much as you are he</p>
<p> </p>
<p>do not say who is that</p>
<p>that writes this</p>
<p>I do not know him</p>
<p> </p>
<p>no matter what he says</p>
<p>it will not hurt for long</p>
<p>just a little pinch</p>
<p> </p>
<p>like a doctor giving a shot</p>
<p>his words will heal you in the end</p>
<p>it will hurt him more than it hurts you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>he will not preserve your pain</p>
<p>only hold it up shining to the night</p>
<p>like a broken sexton</p>
<p> </p>
<p>after a while you will be released from your agony</p>
<p>you will be left at peace and adrift</p>
<p>in a small boat now all your own</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you will have clean water and food for your mind</p>
<p>perhaps a wooden oar or a golden sail full of wind if you wish</p>
<p>and a map just in case you are ever lost here again</p>
<p> </p>
<p>never call it mutiny</p>
<p>or torture the words that swirl in his wake</p>
<p>as he slips beneath the waves hoarse from screaming</p>
<p> </p>
<p>for it was he who spoke up when you bobbed </p>
<p>and wretched your way across the lonely sea</p>
<p>and you know you will need his help again</p>
