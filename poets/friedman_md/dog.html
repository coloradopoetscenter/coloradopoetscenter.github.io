        <h1>A Good Dog</h1>
              <p>It was white steam curling over the pot&rsquo;s lip,</p>
              <p>the bumping cobs of corn bobbing in bubbles,</p>
              <p>the thick, sun-warm, bleeding slices</p>
              <p>of Beef Steak Tomatoes and, especially,</p>
              <p>the yellow butter&rsquo;s languid pose</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>that signaled summer was finally here.</p>
              <p>The previous November just days</p>
              <p>after his twenty third birthday my brother was found</p>
              <p>under a pile of decomposing leaves face</p>
              <p>down in a deserted Missouri wood.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We heard it first on the St. Louis news:</p>
              <p>After a month missing from a St. Charles&rsquo;s Radio Shack,</p>
              <p>two employees found shot in back of head,</p>
              <p>execution style, motive still not known</p>
              <p>for the lunch time abduction.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>For the first time that summer</p>
              <p>Dad phoned Mom to &ldquo;put the water on&rdquo;</p>
              <p>he was coming home with freshly picked sweet corn.</p>
              <p>It was the only time I remember Mom forgot</p>
              <p>to add her secret spoon of sugar to the pot.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We sat at the table closer than normal</p>
              <p>around a small basket of wilting memories</p>
              <p>gnawed by a nagging emptiness</p>
              <p>not discussing that which</p>
              <p>never made sense&hellip;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When Sister, our dog, snuck in to beg the summer food</p>
              <p>she only just sniffed anyway, one stern look from Dad</p>
              <p>and she sulked to her place by the kitchen door.</p>
              <p>She laid down in trained disappointment,</p>
              <p>persisting, almost human, a good dog.</p>
              <p></p>
