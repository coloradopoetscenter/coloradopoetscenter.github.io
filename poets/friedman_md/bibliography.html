              <h1>Bibliography</h1>
              <p>All books are available through <a href="http://www.poetscoop.org">Internet Poets&rsquo; Cooperative</a>.</p>
              <p>In <a href="http://www.poetscoop.org/free.htm#bom">The Body of the Mind</a> M. D. Friedman has created an interlocking medley of 20 of his most purposeful poems composed over a period of thirty years. The intent of his selection is to expand the boundaries of human connection through the use of language art and image.</p>
              <p>His second book, <a href="http://www.poetscoop.org/free.htm#mdf">From Here to Here</a>, M. D. describes as an &ldquo;involuntary exploration of the polarity of love and loneliness.&rdquo;</p>
              <p> <br />
                His third book,<a href="http://www.poetscoop.org/free.htm#nomat"> Nothing Else Matters</a>, has been the top downloaded e-book at the Internet Poets&rsquo; Cooperative for the last year. This manuscript runs the gauntlet from the comic to the tragic, from the political to the sublime.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.poetscoop.org/free.htm#wwr">Where We Reach</a> , M.D.'s newest release, includes some of his best work yet. With brutal honesty and sometimes acrid humor, M. D. soars and stumbles from confusion to love. Packed with stunning original photographs and artwork, this volume is a treat for the eyes and the ears.</p>
