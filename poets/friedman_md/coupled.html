<h1>Coupled Socks
</h1>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is not the coupled socks that interest me</p>
<p>as I spread my darks across my unmade bed</p>
<p>but those newly found ones that arrive each week</p>
<p>without a partner. I have always taken it as proof</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>of the porous nature of our universe, a weekly lecture</p>
<p>on the impermanence of relationship, a poignant reminder</p>
<p>of personal taboo, and of how my own conventional nature</p>
<p>bars me from that place of making my own pairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wearing one black with one brown or even one all white one</p>
<p>with my one sporty red-striped one would be a start.</p>
<p>(After a few washes I am never quite sure</p>
<p>which are dark blue and which are black anyway).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Still, as regularly as the evening news,</p>
<p>new unmatched &ldquo;pairs&rdquo; show up</p>
<p>on these love strewn sheets</p>
<p>where just hours ago we coupled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wonder why I continue to try</p>
<p>and mate them even in good light</p>
<p>even after that one wild night when defiantly</p>
<p>I wore a black with a blue and nothing bad happened.</p>
