<h1>Selling Our Children for Gambling Money
</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Parenthood is always a gamble.</p>
<p>That crap shoot fusion of egg and sperm,</p>
<p>the flesh explosion of another life into ours,</p>
<p>the atomic challenge of being human</p>
<p>with its associated fallout of trying to be</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>even a better person than we are.</p>
<p>We seem to forget ourselves</p>
<p>under the mushroom cloud of the nuclear family,</p>
<p>putting aside our wants for someone else.</p>
<p>Every child comes with a price:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>those things we settle for,</p>
<p>those dreams we let go of,</p>
<p>and that promise there is never enough time to keep.</p>
<p>Then these children become people of a sort,</p>
<p>and grow in their parasitism hopefully toward mutualism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are always seeking</p>
<p>a better life for those we spawn,</p>
<p>perhaps this ticket is a winner,</p>
<p>perhaps just another whiner.</p>
<p>And maybe one day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they will even buy our story.</p>
<p>This morning we wake like every morning,</p>
<p>make our tired bed, fix our low fat breakfast,</p>
<p>and we sell ourselves again. We wonder at where</p>
<p>the time has gone. We wonder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>when they grew up and how they know</p>
<p>to speak, to walk, to even breathe now</p>
<p>without our constant neglected guidance,</p>
<p>but we wonder most if they will ever know</p>
<p>how much is enough to ask for their own lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then one morning</p>
<p>all children wake up,</p>
<p>make their own bed, fix their own breakfast,</p>
<p>go out into the world</p>
<p>and sell themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
