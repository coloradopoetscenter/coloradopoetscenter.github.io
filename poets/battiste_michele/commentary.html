She's ready to  take flight at the smallest provocation, wings oiled up, in tune with the mad  universe.&quot; <br /> - Jim Daniels, on <em>Ink  for an Odd Cartography</em></p>  <p>&quot;In her third chapbook, Michele Battiste presents poems  of such a dynamic intelligence that the reader finds herself exhilarated: It's  like riding with the top down!...Battiste has an exceedingly sharp eye and an  even sharper wit. Smart, passionate, and complex, these poems remind us that our  lives are far more exciting than we sometimes think.&quot;<br />  - Kelly Cherry, on <em>Slow  the Appetite Down</em></p>  <p>&quot;This is an extraordinary collection, and its strain of  defiant, blood-shirring gypsy music is the tonic you&rsquo;ve been looking for.&quot;<br /> â€”Albert Goldbarth, on <em>Uprising</em></p>  <p>&quot;With the intimacy of lyric and the scale of epic,  Uprising brings an important story of the twentieth century close to us in  vital terms.&quot;<br /> - David Mason, on <em>Uprising</em></p>
