          <h1>AMERICAN PROVERB: what a woman doesn't know, she imagines.</h1>
          <p>(first published in <em>American Poetry Review</em>)</p>
          <p>The fall from the balcony, not so<br />
            bad.  What survives on a regular<br />
            basis: sticks, shoes, plastic  cups, <br />
            anything metal.  Anything sharp</p>
          <p>stays sharp, though it may bend.<br />
            Most objects are worth  retrieving.<br />
            Some appear valuable from great<br />
            or even mediocre heights.  One</p>
          <p>night she stands on a chair.  One<br />
            night she leans over the railing.<br />
            One thing she knows though no<br />
            one told her. What we've lost is  what</p>
          <p>we desire.</p>
