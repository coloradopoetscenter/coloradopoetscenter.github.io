  <h1>AMERICAN PROVERB: what a woman doesn't know, she imagines.</h1>  <p>(first published in <em>American Poetry Review</em>)</p>  <p>The fall from the balcony, not so<br /> bad.  What survives on a regular<br /> basis: sticks, shoes, plastic  cups, <br /> anything metal.  Anything sharp</p>  <p>stays sharp, though it may bend.<br /> Most objects are worth  retrieving.<br /> Some appear valuable from great<br /> or even mediocre heights.  One</p>  <p>night she stands on a chair.  One<br /> night she leans over the railing.<br /> One thing she knows though no<br /> one told her. What we've lost is  what</p>  <p>we desire.</p>
