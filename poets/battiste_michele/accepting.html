  <h1>Accepting the Newborn </h1>  <p>Bees  are dying, eon-old tree<br /> frog  species appear to have<br /> disappeared,  coy leaflets hiding<br /> only  dew and droppings.  I root</p>  <p>for  cutter ants, little bodies<br /> like  keys, locking up entire<br /> Central  American eco-</p>  <p>systems,  their devotion to <br /> compost  carved into rainforest <br /> floors,  mapping the cycle of food <br /> then  life, then food.  What I wish for </p>  <p>you  is complicated.  It&rsquo;s a <br /> guilty  trade when the littlest <br /> ones  go first, go fast, and beckon.</p>
