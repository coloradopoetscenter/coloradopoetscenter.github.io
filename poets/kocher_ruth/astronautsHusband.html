<h1>The Window Cleaner Writes to the Astronaut's Husband</h1>
<p>Now  that she has not come back<br />
I  will tell you.</p>
<p>It  is not that her face disappeared among<br />the  constellations</p>
<p>or  that you wake space-tumbled from sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />the  last digital glimpse of dark skin&nbsp;&nbsp; her  tied-back hair</p>
<p>leaving  you. You expect this way of mourning<br />as  you expect an open door to lead to a room</p>
<p>which  leads to another room&nbsp;&nbsp; a corridor of  blank walls<br />that  contain your passage. You are shaken</p>
<p>by  gravity. Each morning your feet touch the floor.<br />You  stand. You walk. The sink twists the light above <br />into  reflection as you brush your teeth. Understand<br />  it  is pull that failed her&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fails you&mdash;</p>
<p>our  insistent&nbsp;&nbsp; magnetic planet&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />a  wanting back what it dared release</p>
<p>to  a rocket&rsquo;s surge. Understand the physics<br />of  greed&nbsp;&nbsp; the orbit of earth as a circle of  want&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>the  way we are each held beyond our will<br />and  that never&nbsp;&nbsp; never&nbsp;&nbsp; could it have left her free.</p>
