              <h1>The Window Cleaner Dreams of Grass
              </h1>
              <p>A  morning can be all about earth<br />
              and  the epistles that spring from it.</p>
              <p>Scene  6: The day is unremarkable. Magnolia<br />
                takes  up flourishing in usual lushness.</p>
              <p><em>it is summer it is summer it  is summer </em><br />
                Window  squares reflect crosswalk-lines<br />
                interrupt  sky upon blue sky<br />
          upon  blue</p>
              <p>Scene  6: The smell&nbsp;&nbsp; somehow undone&nbsp;&nbsp; first picked<br />
                green&nbsp;&nbsp; yes&nbsp;&nbsp; but  familiar to the body that takes it&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          accords  it light in a way</p>
              <p>most  opaque&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  sifted<br />
                turned  out</p>
              <p>moss  creek on her breath. <br />
                Epilogue:</p>
