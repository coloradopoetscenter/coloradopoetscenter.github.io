<p>where does the poem come from</p>
<p>some think it is god</p>
<p>others suffering</p>
<p>i believed at some point</p>
<p>that poem and place were the same</p>
<p>a map of the washboard</p>
<p>roads of someone's existence</p>
<p>then there are those</p>
<p>pulling poems from</p>
<p>the air into their nets</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>i think of Pablo</p>
<p>he would probably say</p>
<p>the poem is the spaces</p>
<p>between the mesh net</p>
<p>not what we bring to our hands</p>
<p>or ashore but</p>
<p>what escapes us</p>
<p>the water flowing </p>
<p>back to her mother</p>
<p>the butterfly pushed away</p>
<p>by the whoosh of the net</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>poems are like people</p>
<p>they come from everywhere</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>still there is no definition</p>
<p>that is mine</p>
<p>no meteorite burning red</p>
<p>in the 3:00 a.m. sky</p>
<p>no brief electricity</p>
<p>of a first kiss</p>
<p>define define define</p>
<p>the poem is</p>
<p>what would have happened</p>
<p>if Tristan and Isolde had lived</p>
<p>some mad potion</p>
<p>that is supposed to be death</p>
<p>and is instead</p>
<p>the way we fall and live</p>
<p>more fully because we have fallen</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>and then there is still</p>
<p>this lack of my own definition</p>
<p>and where it will persist</p>
<p>the backbeat of a song</p>
<p>that is its heart</p>
<p>the things we wish to say</p>
<p>and don't</p>
<p>the way unsaid things</p>
<p>try to live</p>
<p>even as we kill them</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>here is my definition</p>
<p>tomorrow there will be</p>
<p>a new river</p>
<p>but today at 10:03 a.m.</p>
<p>on a friday</p>
<p>the poem is thursday and saturday</p>
<p>it is what burns us</p>
<p>makes us love</p>
<p>what used to be</p>
<p>as we hope that </p>
<p>tomorrow the poem will be</p>
<p>newborn again into the sky</p>
<p>much like venus or our sun</p>
<p>in the hours before we wake</p>
