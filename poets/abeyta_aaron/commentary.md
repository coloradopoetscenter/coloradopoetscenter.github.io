<h2>Commentary (on forthcoming <em>As Orion Falls</em>)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other voice that conjures the sky and keeps count of stars as human migrations, moving, fading, and bursting anew as Abeyta&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Here he is standing naked and alone on the abandoned snow drifts and tierras, holding them as fallen angels and stellar evidence of our birthright - the luminous lands we claimed we would honor thirty-five years ago. Abeyta speaks with the voices of Nazim Hikmet, Jim Sagel, Allison Hedge-Coke and Albert Hunter, all lovers of the small earth and its colossal heart.&rdquo; - (Juan Felipe Herrera, author of <em>Cinnamon Girl: Letteres Found Inside a Cereal Box)</em></p>
