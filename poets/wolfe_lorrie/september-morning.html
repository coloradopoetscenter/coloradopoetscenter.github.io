<h1>September Morning</h1><p>Unexpected first frost<br />  the lightest glaze<br />  across the field</p><p>a fine line drawn down the ruckled trunk <br />  of the old cottonwoodÂ  -- <br />  a beard that was not there yesterday<br />  a portent of more white to come</p><p>Amid bursts of red and purple<br />  summer&rsquo;s last revel splayed <br />  in final fevered abandon</p><p>sumac, <br />  like the reddened lips of teenage girls<br />  quivers with anticipation</p><p>while I see an icy arc<br />  in a color not used<br />  these five months</p><p>It drifts like Egyptian gauze<br />  across the pale gold grasses<br />  along the ditch bank</p><p>Fuchsia cosmos dip their heads<br />  nodding in humbled obeisance<br />  and poplars drop golden tributes</p><p>one<br />  by one<br />  onto the brief<br />  shining carpet</p> <p align="right"><em>(Published in Progenitor 50, Art and Literary Journal, 2015.)</em></p>
