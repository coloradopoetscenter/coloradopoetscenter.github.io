            <h1>Braided Lives</h1>
            <p>Rivka bought a yellow-legged chicken, fresh carrots at the greengrocer<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       His secretary put through the call from the hospital<br />
              She had parsley curling on the windowsill<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        How could she have heart failure?<br />
              Potatoes and onions in barrels of straw<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        She had gone to a friend&rsquo;s to stay overnight<br />
              Enough to last till summer<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       Perhaps she had been frightened<br />
              She planted to remember <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        She had gotten up to go to the bathroom<br />
              The farm, her family, her roots<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        Confused, in the dark<br />
              Her sisters, singing<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        The friend heard something<br />
              The smell of browned onions<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        In the morning, they found her<br />
              A stew, with an extra potato could make a welcome<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       How awful to be alone<br />
              When home was too far<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       He drove, unaware<br />
              If anyone in the family<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        Made the car signal, turn <br />
              Happened to come by<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       When the other cars moved<br />
              She was always looking out for them<br />
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                               By the time he got there, she was gone</p>
