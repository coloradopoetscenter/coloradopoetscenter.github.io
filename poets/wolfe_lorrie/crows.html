<h1>The Language of Crows </h1><p><em>for Aaron</em></p><p>When you are far <br />  I hear you in the language of crows<br />  Calling dawn into the lightening sky<br />  Inky night distilled<br />  Into feathers, wings<br />  Onyx eye</p><p>In memory I see you <br />  Clamber across branches<br />  After chittering squirrels<br />  And teasing crows<br />  Watch your feet, I say <br />  A talisman against broken bones</p><p>The little boy has flown<br />  Now you can name <br />  Every muscle and bone<br />  That held you strong <br />  High enough to see<br />  The whole world <br />  As you perched<br />  in the maple&rsquo;s canopy </p><p>You are fully fledged<br />  Now the mountain holds you<br />  Bestows its old knowledge<br />  To your fingers, your sinews<br />  Listen, it says<br />  I will tell you <br />  What you have always <br />  Wanted to know<br />  In the language of seasons<br />  Of tea<br />  Of silence</p><p>When words fail <br />  I still hear you<br />  In the language of crows</p>  <p align="right"><em>(Published in Pooled Ink, 2014)</em></p>
