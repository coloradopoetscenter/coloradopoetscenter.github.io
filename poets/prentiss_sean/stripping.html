  <h1><a name="_Toc376421868" id="_Toc376421868">Stripping</a></h1>  <p>Published at<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a> <em>Green Mountains Review Online</em></p>  <p>Like a  benediction, we grow into a smaller language. So many words given up,  disremembered, abandoned from tents &amp; saw packs. What use here in the  Middle Santiam Wilderness do we have for the word <em>sink</em>? When would we ever utter <em>closet </em>or <em>phone </em>or <em>bank account</em>? These words as unneeded as any third thumb, as  unneeded as <em>money </em>or <em>wallet </em>or <em>credit card. Girlfriend </em>becomes little more than a weekend ghost. I  give to you <em>TV. </em>I give to you<em> movie theatre. </em>I give to you <em>radio</em>. Do you want more words that these  backwoods winds strip away? Take <em>traffic  jam. </em>Take<em> fuel pump. </em>Take<em> the 9-to-5. </em>God, take<em> commuting </em>&amp; <em>pavement. </em>Take <em>asphalt </em>&amp; <em>concrete</em>. Take, please, we beg of  you, <em>microwave. </em>Take <em>power lines. </em>Take <em>nightly news. </em>We give them all away. </p>  <p>Those words,  they ache our new memories.</p>
