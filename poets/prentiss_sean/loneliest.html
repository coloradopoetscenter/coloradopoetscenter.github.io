  <h1>The Loneliest of Electrons</h1>  <p>Published by <em>Spoon River</em></p>  <p>When we first met in Cologne [seven  centuries ago], our love <br /> was pure European alchemy. No  science to that attraction.<br /> Just a philosophical belief that  love and the Classic Elements<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"> </a> <br /> would carry us. We tried [so  vainly, we tried] to transmutate<br /> what we had [<em>All the elements of love</em>, we whispered] <br /> into precious gold. We experimented  but ended <br /> with just batches [batches batches]  of useless panacea. </p>  <p>Later, after our fifth breakup [the  summer of 1661], I rented a threadbare <br /> laboratory in a London brownstone  overlooking the River Thames <br /> and delved into that newest  science—chymistry, discovering <br /> the smallest things of love and  life, which I named atoms<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"> </a>. <br /> I studied the parts—protons [secure  like your new lovers] <br /> hugging the nucleus [you]. In the  outer reaches of all of this—<br /> the loneliest of electrons  [me]—unstable and spinning a sad orbital.</p>  <p>Sometime after the nuclide of our  love fissioned for the seventh time <br /> [how can that be—I named us <em>uncuttable</em>?] during winter in Red Hook <br /> 1837, I realized I needed no  laboratory—no fancy equipment <br /> —to understand acidity and  basicity. After so many bad reactions<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"> </a>, <br /> we proved [beyond any doubt] that the  crucial things <br /> exchanged between acids and bases  [or two broken lovers] <br /> are just charges [You to me—<em>Liar</em>! Me to you—<em>Whore!]</em>.</p>  <p><em>One  last experiment</em>, we pleaded to the other. We consented, <br /> then moved to Los Alamos, 1942. I  attempted to transform <br /> our substances through our  interactions with the other. [Remember?] <br /><em>One  last experiment</em>, we said—and meant it. But we failed. <br /> We never had the form of energy  needed. <br /> After Los Alamos, there were no  more chemical bonds <br /> of love. Just oxidation. Just  reduction. Dissociation.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"> </a></p>  <p>Over seven hundred years I delved  into alchemy, conjectured <br /> the science of chymistry, perfected  modern chemistry. With all this <br /> science, I just spin round and  round [the least stable of electrons] <br /> and posit, <em>What if we are atoms<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5"> </a></em>[no longer protons and electrons]<em>?  What if </em><br /><em>I  can fuse us</em><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6"> </a><em> together, like that first night?<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7"> </a></em> I return to the lab, <br /> muttering to the useless beakers  and Bunsen burners, <em>Chemical bonding? </em><br /><em>It  is more than repulsion. Can it be more than attraction?</em></p> <hr/> <ol><li> <a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="" id="_ftn1"> </a> For us,  our elements / only fire—love, lust, need.</li><li><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="" id="_ftn2"> </a> After  the Greek word / &ldquo;uncuttable.&rdquo; / <em>Our love</em>,  I hummed.</li><li><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="" id="_ftn3"> </a> Broken  plates / broken hearts / broken promises / broken hearts.</li><li><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="" id="_ftn4"> </a> We  haven&rsquo;t talk for over a / century.
