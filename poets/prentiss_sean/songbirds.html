  <h1>The Infidelity of Songbirds </h1>  <p>Published by <em>Sycamore Review</em></p>  <blockquote> <p>I</p>  </blockquote>  <p>She said, / <em>Female infidelity occurs in Western sandpipers</em> <em>and in </em>/<em> thrushes,</em> /<br /> <em>in  rockfowls and Kentish plovers, / in tanagers</em> <em>and</em> <em>shorebirds—</em> / <em>in all of them.</em><br /> She spoke as if the science of  mating made her words / easier.</p>  <blockquote> <p>II</p>  </blockquote>  <p>She went on (counting on her  fingers): / <em>Female infidelity occurs</em> /<br /> <em>in  starlings and tits,</em> / <em>in berrypeckers  and sunbirds,</em> / <em>in honeycreepers </em>/<br /> <em>and  flowerpeckers. </em>/ <em>Your favorites</em>.  / <em>Even in flowerpeckers. </em></p>  <blockquote> <p>III</p>  </blockquote>  <p>With  songbirds, there is an appearance of monogamy— / <br /> of  fatherbirds / and motherbirds / together / raising helpless chicks. / <br /> But  appearance and reality differ / as much as arms and wings, / lips and beaks.</p>  <blockquote> <p>IV</p>  </blockquote>  <p>She went on:  / <em>There&rsquo;s more about</em> <em>songbirds</em>. / She talked something /<br /> about  genetic variability, DNA, / freshening / the familial line, /<br /> about &ldquo;it&rdquo; /  (<em>All of it</em>, she said) / being the  nature of things. </p>  <blockquote> <p>V</p>  </blockquote>  <p>When pressed, she said, <em>It&rsquo;s an</em> <em>insurance policy,</em> / <em>it&rsquo;s about  finding the strongest</em> /<br /> <em>sperm,</em> /<em> protecting the species</em>. / Then  quieter, / whispered, /<em> Finding</em> /<br /> <em>the  best</em> <em>mate</em>. / She never said, / <em>It&rsquo;s about all they can taste</em>. / <em>That nectar</em>.</p>  <blockquote> <p>VI</p>  </blockquote>  <p>What is  monogamy / but one female (her) / and one male (you?) / reproducing /<br /> exclusively  with the other. / Or maybe monogamy / is a love that settles /<br /> on a branch.  / She never spoke anything like that. / Her birds, they never sang / that song.</p>
