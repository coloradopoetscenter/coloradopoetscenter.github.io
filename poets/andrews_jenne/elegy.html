          <h1>Elegy for a Phantom Bride</h1>
          <p>-- after  Elegy, Natasha Trethewey</p>
          <p><em>Nuit d'hymenee!<br />
          O douce nuit d'amour!<br />
          La destine<br />
          M'enchaine a toi sans retour.</em></p>
<p>Romeo et Juliette, Charles Gounod</p>
          <p>That night the air was cloyed with mosquitoes,<br />
          their heady sanguine rendezvous to make more </p>
<p>of their kind among the wealth of living things <br />
  out in the cooling pastures.  Early June, when </p>
<p>it occurred to me I might make do with her <br />
  wedding dress, post-war Santa Fe couture: </p>
<p>unadorned chiffon waterfall over French taffeta. <br />
  The next morning I found it in the steamer trunk </p>
          <p>in the study,  nestled in slightly yellowed tissue <br />
          paper, as if the sun had stolen in to scent and </p>
<p>tint what she had worn,  boring through chipped <br />
  and sprung brass locks.  I stood in the mirror </p>
<p>in the rippling shadows, spectral, young, more <br />
  like a bel canto Lucia  descending the stairs in </p>
<p>the euphoria of madness than a bride happy, <br />
  happy;    I was not, you see, and I could not tell </p>
<p>him, no words rose to my tongue, not even <br />
  when we drank our summer margaritas looking </p>
<p>out over the snow-capped mountains—I could <br />
  not say to myself that I didn't love him,  was only </p>
<p>afraid to go on alone, my mother's death aching <br />
  within me like an inflamed seam of tangerine </p>
<p>light marrying foothills and sky.   Two weeks <br />
  later, just as if I were moving in water, chiffon </p>
<p>billowing around me, Mother's vestal ghost <br />
  carrying my train,  we stood near potted orange </p>
<p>trees while the county judge said his piece.  <br />
  We clung to each other and I promised myself </p>
<p>I could graft my heart to his ebullience.   Does it <br />
  matter now it never happened, that our wedding </p>
<p>night recedes as if it were someone else's, caught <br />
  in a gold-leaf frame like a Victorian liaison </p>
<p>between two stoics for the sake of a bloodline? <br />
  In that  Renoir in my mind, the allusion to bliss </p>
<p>only, intimated by the linens' rumpling, nude's <br />
  pale back to her painter, groom's notable absence, </p>
<p>the late spring burning in the long window—<br />
  nothing less and nothing more.</p>
