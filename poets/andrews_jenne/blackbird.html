  <h1>Blackbird Amore</h1>  <p>They manifest like a sprinkling of ash on the dawn, <br />  congregating motes from a far heaven.</p>
<p>They are annunciations in blue black, shimmering <br />in the young cattails, the wing's red badge </p>
<p>that says, I am of the garrison of joy and I have come,<br />and I am not Icarus and I am not a barn swallow, </p>
<p>nor am I a disconsolate sparrow with her half-hearted <br />motet, or the barrio crow clacking for scraps, </p>
<p>or the furtive owl sitting high in the oaks <br />like a jaded bartender.</p>
<p>I sing Verdi, you sing Mozart. I sing today <br />and you sing tomorrow. </p>
<p>We are the small and temporal things appearing <br />in the corner of your eye when you flash past, </p>
<p>warbling in our epaulettes, strafing the marsh <br />to route the hovercraft of the dragonfly, </p>
<p>trumping the laggard lark with our midair <br />pirouettes-- ballet rouge in the empire of love.</p>
