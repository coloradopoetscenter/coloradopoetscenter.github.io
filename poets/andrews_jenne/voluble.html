          <h1>From the poem &quot;Voluble Dusk&quot;:</h1>
          <p>When the old mares pulled a night wagon <br />
          over day's end, she tucked me in; </p>
<p>she was mother then, and her moon face <br />
  came over me and I touched the cheeks </p>
<p>of the moon, and its soft dark curls, <br />
  and watched her mouth move with lulling </p>
<p>rhymes;  I remember them; she would bathe <br />
  me, scrubbing me on a towel on the bed, </p>
<p>later holding my head in warm tap water <br />
  to lather my hair; I would cry, and they </p>
<p>would laugh and scold. Not long after, <br />
  the desert dark of madness folded long </p>
<p>wings around her; days and nights <br />
  of absence then, before her return without </p>
<p>tears or laughter. Forever afterward, <br />
  her face would shine in the crepuscule, </p>
<p>a luminosity that lingered there while <br />
  I sat at the piano, tentative girl learning </p>
<p>Schubert and Brahms.  She listened in her <br />
  cherry platform rocker and drank; </p>
<p>to forestall our severing from one another <br />
  in the voluble dusk,  I played on.</p>
