          <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          <p><strong>Nationally acclaimed poet Jim Moore,</strong><em> Invisible Strings</em>, <strong>Graywolf Press 2011</strong>,   writes of Andrews' new collection:  <em>&quot;The underlying grace note of this book is love:   love of all kinds, for the present body and the lost past, for the wandering surprises in   a given moment, for the deep certainties and even deeper questions that both stain and   illumine a life in poetry.&quot;   </em></p>
          <p><strong>Dawn Potter,</strong> <em>A Poet's Sourcebook: Writings on Poetry, from the Ancient World to   the Present, </em><strong>Autumn House Press 2012</strong>, and Director, Conference on Poetry   and Teaching, The Frost Place, comments,<em> &quot;Jenne Andrews' poems are saturated   with color and with music. But more importantly, they overflow with feeling: a deep,   unabashed commitment to the knife edge of joy and heartbreak.   </em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;We are the small and temporal things appearing / in the corner of your eye when you   flash past,&quot; she says. Such lines are a version of suffering; they rail against invisibility.   Yet though she declares, &quot;if I knew who I am, or who I ever was / or might become, I   would be at rest,&quot; the reader understands that Andrews's restlessness is at one with her   music. They are interwoven elements of her work and cannot be separated.&quot;</em></p>
