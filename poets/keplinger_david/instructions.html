<h1>Instructions for the Lost</h1>
<p>Above the cellars <br />Lined with preserves,<br />In a foreign year, <br />Its calendar girls<br />Naked except for their parasols,<br />You may find <br />That you are lost. <br />You may listen <br />To the gurgle of the small <br />Red chimneys<br />Filling up with dark. <br />Into that dark <br />That sleeves <br />The bare branches <br />Like a heavy sack,<br />A crow will disappear, children.<br />Pay attention to the crow.<br />The windpipe <br />  With its tiny rungs.</p>
<p> From THE CLEARING, 2005</p>
