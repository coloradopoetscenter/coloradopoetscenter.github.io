              <h1>Elegy for the Precious Time Before Dinner</h1>
              <p> Along the fringe of the two known worlds<br />
  Of field, of prison yard,<br />
  Behind the house my mother and her sisters<br />
  Live in, this was years ago. </p>
              <p> We're all still there, itinerant <br />
  As wind, the straits of corn<br />
  And prison guards who pace their impossible promontories, <br />
  And the small mouse just born into this world,<br />
  Total as a thumb. </p>
              <p> With her sisters who are dead my mother is a beauty <br />
  Taking the spoon <br />
  To beat the dog away from the pot, <br />
  At which they all begin to laugh. </p>
              <p> Little beetles with a kind of Viking armor<br />
  I want to smash you, smash the spiders <br />
  Atop their pagodas<br />
  Like bad thoughts,<br />
  Smash the crazy locust that won't abandon its post. </p>
              <p> At the house the women happily<br />
  Eye up the sauce about to boil.<br />
  I am wearing my emblematic cape.<br />
  I can fly at any moment if I want to,<br />
  But I don't. </p>
              <p>From THE CLEARING, 2005 </p>
