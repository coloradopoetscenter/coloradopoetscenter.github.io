        <h1>Commentary on Judyth Hill&rsquo;s Work….</h1>
        
        <p>Don&rsquo;t look for the mini-tragedies of office affairs or the wine-soaked ambiguities of fashionable angst in the poetry of Judyth Hill. No, she is post-Blakean exuberance, shamelessly ecstatic and exclamatory, proclaiming her unfettered joy in being alive.<br />
          --<strong>Sam Hamill</strong>, author of over 40 books, 15 books of original poetry,  4 collections of essays, 2 dozen books of translations, founding editor of Copper Canyon Press</p>
        <p>Judyth Hill&rsquo;s <em>Dazzling Wobble</em> is a whirling dervish—a love poem, not only to the<em> you</em>, and to the reader, but to a luminous world where &ldquo;every alley, every sidewalk crack is breathing in enormous broken joy.&rdquo; Writing with the ecstasy of a postmodern Rumi, Hill weaves together <em>everything</em> to create a sensuous and generous presence, where &ldquo;this warmth on my skin is delicious and irrevocable.&rdquo; <br />

        <p>Judyth Hill is a &quot;Doorway Woman&quot;, offering us a freshly visioned world, a world to wake our hearts. These poems move where the possibilities are vast. She can suddenly burst into wind or rain or desert flower; a woman who says &quot;Take me as bedrock&quot;. These lines are full of song and wind and heart and love. <br />
          --<strong>Gary Lawless</strong> , author of 16 books,  latest book: <em>How to Live On The Planet Earth</em> - <em>Collected Poems</em>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-author=Nanao%20Sakaki&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;search-alias=books&amp;sort=relevancerank">Nanao Sakaki</a> (Author), Gary Lawless (Editor) </p>
        <p>Judyth Hill is a poetic transformer whose work lights up the reader's whole body/mind power grid. Her sensuous lists find the musical in the commonplace and her Blakean insights keep reminding us of the world's hidden splendor, &ldquo;The hummingbird&rsquo;s fierce morsel of a heart races, / even while asleep&quot;. &ldquo;At a moment when too much American poetry seems colorless and lethargic, Hill returns to us the shock of something at once new and ancient: the sheer elation of being alive.&nbsp;<br />
          —<strong>Joseph Hutchison,</strong> author of 10 books, latest is <em>Thread of the Real.</em></p>
        <p>A lush and lavish glossolalia, Hill&rsquo;s language  both conceives and contains love, to get inside its nature and the natural world which call us out of ourselves into larger and larger loving...Hill&rsquo;s poems seem written in &ldquo;juggernaut gold.&rdquo;  <br />
                                                       -- <strong>Veronica Golos</strong>, author of <em>Vocabulary of Silence</em></p>
        <p>The interplay of desire and satisfaction remains Judyth Hill&rsquo;s storyline—the way of delectable and words to roll around on the tongue. She follows the Peach Pie Strategy of bounty. &ldquo;Be prepared for anything, absolutely anything,&rdquo; she says. This speaks for itself. Friend, come to this world in a big way, be tough, read these poems and swing as the Goddess of Love.<br />
