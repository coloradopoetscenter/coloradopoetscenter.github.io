<h1>There&rsquo;s No Place the White Clouds Can&rsquo;t Go</h1><p>  Shu Shan K&rsquo;uang Jen<br />  9th Century, Chinese</p><p>Nowhere the plumage of doves and angels <br />  isn&rsquo;t moving <br />  over the dusty stairways of the Ancient City.</p><p>The Moorish tiles spell </p><p>as always, the name of God <br />  in letters of fire, <br />  in the shade of blue that is exactly your eyes after love.</p><p>I know both those loves.<br />  They take wing inside me,<br />  as if I were an invented city <br />  and you had designed the streets.</p><p>I am all plaza and gazebo, 100% zocalo<br />where women <br />in long silks spin in an ecstasy of Godfire.</p><p>That is how it is entirely.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>Ajah, Ajah, - <br />  Come to me as if you are me<br />and I will come to you</p><p>Every alley, every sidewalk<br />  crack is breathing in enormous broken joy</p><p>You know we have come at last home<br />  because we can&rsquo;t see anything here<br />  that is not already the Beloved.</p><p><strong>Published in <em>Dazzling Wobble</em>, FutureCycle Press, 2013, Mineral Bluff, Georgia</strong></p>
