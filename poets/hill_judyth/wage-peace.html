<h1>Wage Peace</h1><p>Wage peace with your breath.<br /><br />Breathe in firemen and rubble,<br />breathe out whole buildings and flocks of red wing blackbirds.<br /><br />Breathe in terrorists <br />and breathe out sleeping children and freshly mown fields.<br /><br />Breathe in confusion and breathe out maple trees.<br /><br />Breathe in the fallen and breathe out lifelong friendships intact.<br /><br />  Wage peace with your listening: hearing sirens, pray loud.<br /><br />  Remember your tools: flower seeds, clothes pins, clean rivers.<br /><br />  Make soup.<br /><br />  Play music, memorize the words for thank you in three languages.<br /><br />  Learn to knit, and make a hat.<br /><br />  Think of chaos as dancing raspberries,<br />  imagine grief <br />  as the outbreath of beauty <br />  or the gesture of fish.<br /><br />  Swim for the other side.<br /><br />  Wage peace.<br /><br />  Never has the world seemed so fresh and precious:<br /><br />  Have a cup of tea and rejoice.<br /><br />  Act as if armistice has already arrived.<br />  Celebrate today.<br /><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Published in <em>TzimTzum,</em> Mercury HeartLink, 2014, Santa Fe, NM<br /></strong></p>
