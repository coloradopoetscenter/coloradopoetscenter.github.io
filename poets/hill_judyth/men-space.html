        <h1>Men Need Space</h1>
        <p>Men need space.<br />
          We&rsquo;re talking South Dakota.  Wyoming.<br />
          Men need Wyoming and the Mid-West.<br />
          The Mid-West was invented for men.<br />
          And it&rsquo;s a good thing, because women hate the Mid-West.<br />
          What&rsquo;s to like?  The only good part is Chicago and moving away.<br />
          If Godzilla finally ate the place,<br />
          we&rsquo;d only miss Seurat, Wrigley&rsquo;s Field and pizza.</p>
        <p>The Cubs, my heartbreak team.<br />
          Only men and the Cubs can raise me to the perfect pitch<br />
          of eternal hope and utter despair.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s like longing for Tzatziki in Santa Fe.<br />
          It&rsquo;s the Crusades, with just sand and no Grail,<br />
          A Matisse without blue.<br />
          Jane Austen minus drawing rooms and narrative structure.</p>
        <p>Men make me stupid.<br />
          When my lover leaves I discover a burning need<br />
          to clean out my bathroom shelves.<br />
          I stop hiding the facial hair bleach.<br />
          I throw out all the lipsticks bought from $1 bins.<br />
          Peach, it turns out, is not my shade.<br />
          I&rsquo;m an autumn, whatever that means.</p>
        <p>I suspect it has something to do with men.<br />
          1000 monkeys would have written King Lear and the OED<br />
          long before figuring out the seasonal color theory.<br />
          Bookstores now have whole shelves about men.<br />
          The New Drumming Man.  Men and Zen.<br />
          Men and Your Need for Orgasms.  Men and Pain.<br />
          My question is, yours or theirs?</p>
        <p>Women&rsquo;s magazines have always been about men.<br />
          How To Attract Men With Your Strong Yet Slender Thighs<br />
          How To Attract Men With Your Best Ever Chocolate Cake<br />
          Sheer Lacies With High Necks For That Lewd Yet Innocent Look <br />
              Oh Baby</p>
        <p>And Orgasms.</p>
        <p>How To Have Them With Men<br />
          How to Have Them In Swiftly Moving Vehicles<br />
          Standing In The Shower<br />
          While Baking Best Ever Chocolate Cakes</p>
        <p>Then there are books on how to live through the pain-on-wheels<br />
          due to feeding Best Cake with our devastating Thighs,<br />
          to these longed-for men.</p>
        <p>Now we need meetings.<br />
          We need Co-Dependent No More Or Hardly Ever<br />
          At Least Seldom<br />
          We need How To Love Yourself And Your Great Thighs More<br />
          While Mortifyingly Alone On Saturday Night</p>
        <p>I had the best relationship of my life at Jewel-Osco.<br />
          I bought a bottle of Campari.<br />
          The club soda was right there at the cashiers.<br />
          I said to the Check-Out man, Now all I need is a lime.<br />
          Without missing a beat, he said,<br />
          Yes! And a cute guy to drink it with.<br />
          I said, Yes! And a Pre-Nuptial agreement.<br />
          He said, Yes! And a good divorce lawyer.<br />
          I said, Yes! I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you I need . . .<br />
          ??????<br />
          And he said, Yes! We need to talk.  I need space.</p>
        <p>It was perfect.<br />
          We did the whole thing in three minutes.<br />
          I had recovered by the time I got to my car.</p>
        <p>It spared us months of grief, enormous phone bills.<br />
          I didn&rsquo;t have to introduce him to my parents,<br />
          for whom he would never have been good enough.<br />
          His old girl?friend didn&rsquo;t need to visit.</p>
        <p>I didn&rsquo;t have to get my kids to like him,<br />
          he didn&rsquo;t have to work on my car.</p>
        <p>Now, however, I&rsquo;m in love.<br />
          Honey, he said, Darling, he said, I need space.<br />
          I felt sick.<br />
          He probably did not mean the Great Salt Flats.<br />
          Then he said the kicker, the clincher.<br />
          Sweetheart, it&rsquo;s not you.<br />
          Who isn&rsquo;t me? I ask.<br />
          You are not the reason I need space.<br />
          Who is, I say, my stomach dropping into my Tony Lama&rsquo;s.<br />
          Now, I&rsquo;m dying.<br />
          I want to be the woman he needs space from.</p>
