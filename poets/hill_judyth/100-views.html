        <h1>100 Views of the Floating World </h1>
        
        <p>the real skin to skin ascent.<br />
          Grant me the bluebird of such crazy happiness,  <br />
          feathers to match the horizon of outrageous loving,<br />
          I promise famous embraces and incendiary politics. </p>
        <p>I long <br />
          to be dusting of snow on the Mt Fuji of you,<br />
          your cherrylipped geisha avec jasmine tea and cloud cover,<br />
          a strummed shamisen, pure futon. </p>
        <p>You are the manners brought to my grandmother&rsquo;s table, <br />
          salt cellars, cloth napkins,<br />
          set silver, and please.</p>
        <p>I a horseshoe of desire, your bauble of lucky,<br />
          I&rsquo;ll ring and ring, make you such music<br />
          as does measure what tilts us on the scale of golden, <br />
          turns you iron.</p>
        <p>Milky Way thrown &lsquo;cross the bed sky of night<br />
          Orion in flagrante, o my delicto,<br />
          October is a wind we cannot ride,<br />
          a blur; take the leaves, then take them, <br />
          I have others fashioned in your honor.<br />
          You are magnetic north; I&rsquo;ll spin there.</p>
        <p>A miracle: Fahrenheit of pleasure, you and me, <br />
          what is utterly spoken sinuous, both shedding and enrapt.<br />
          Written language aside, everything spells original temperature. <br />
          All commas point home.<br />
          Where was I ever going,<br />
          but to you?</p>
        <p>Lay me down, then, in the lap of the divine, candles kindled,<br />
          wine poured and new bread: <br />
          whole loaves, baked for the constancy of snow geese.</p>
        <p>You are apple trees in full flush, doors of the temple open,<br />
          the polish of marble. <br />
          It&rsquo;s the rub of love - tectonics of dream -<br />
          how ardent we can constellate into ancient shine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I sign my name on your lips   <br />
          for practice, I sew on your buttons,<br />
          make cream soups daily, simmer and stir.</p>
        <p>I am a student of indoors and learning quickly.<br />
          I know your place, almost.</p>
        <p>Sweetheart, this poem needs you! Come quick!</p>
        <p>This page is incessantly made white by your absence:<br />
          you are this ink, this flowing away and towards,<br />
          these joyous words, these.</p>
