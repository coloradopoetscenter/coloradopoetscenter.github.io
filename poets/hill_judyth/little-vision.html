<h1>Little Vision of the Great Intangible </h1><p>Some vowels disappear<br />  some arc across lines of poetry</p><p>black etched ravens that have lately been cawing, cawing,<br />  their wings are consonants, or would be. </p><p>In the hardness scale, there is no measure for my heart.</p><p>Neither talc, or ruby. <br />  Streak across me, as lightning in the canyon sky.<br />  Leave marks; tattoo divine on my skin.<br />  Ink me into rain.</p><p>Say my name, and I call you into flame, <br />  my secret treasure, my astral tango.</p><p>I go to petals, fragrant, the finality of garden in October<br />  Burnt umber, Sienna, wild thistle and mourning dove.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the puzzle we solve by putting the box away.</p><p>I am porous, you are crazy weather, fallen apples, the chokecherries gotten entirely by jays, mullein stalk gone to pillar and seed, the fallen parts of the wisteria I sweep at my doorway each morning, <br />  what wakes me to startle, redwing and cirrus.</p><p>You arrive in my afternoon, a pot of tea already brewing, hot on the hot stovetop, coals in the grate, bread in the oven, past ferment, into seize and risen.<br />  Golden, sesamed, open that lid – you have the words –<br />  the scent of welcome is over us, a Giotto nimbus, the smoke after the train leaves Finlandia station, a revolution in the air.<br />  None will be left behind this time, gather us all, all into peace, for once,<br />  you can, you can.</p><p>Whatever happens to us  <br />  is in the capable hands of the maple&rsquo;s scarlet leaves.</p><p>Whatever you do next, <br />  is how the peach tree will remember us.</p><p><strong>Published in <em>Dazzling Wobble</em>, FutureCycle Press, 2013, Mineral Bluff, Georgia</strong></p>
