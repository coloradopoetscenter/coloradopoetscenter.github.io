  <h1>Hummingbirds</h1>  <p>It is unlucky to capture hummingbirds<br /> to mistake them for fireflies<br /> condemning them to mason jars on the  mantle piece<br />  demanding their music at night.</p>  <p>You would sentence her thimble children<br /> to an eternity of loneliness.<br /> The wind depends on a jump start<br /> from the hummingbird&rsquo;s wingless flight</p>  <p>and it would remain confounded in the  canyon,<br /> a thoroughbred locked in the starting  gate.<br /> We have been warned of the possibility <br /> of a partial eclipse of the sun<br /> should her sparkling armor<br /> remain too long in the shadows.<br /> Old people propagate altars of  delphiniums<br /> and count on the hummingbird&rsquo;s brief  visits<br /> to heal small fissures of their hearts.</p>  <p>In a dream, a hummingbird hitched  herself<br /> to my rings and flew to her wintering  place,<br /> the center of the sun. She said, I will  protect <br /> your daughter as she enters into the  wilderness <br /> of life, delight her<br /> as the darkness presses in.</p>  <p>And I believe her, for in an aspen grove<br /> in a circle of columbine,<br /> hummingbirds found my daughter asleep in  our tent.<br /> They came and told her their stories,<br /> their beaks clacking in the wind.</p>  <p>And when my daughter runs ahead of us<br /> and seems eaten alive,<br /> by the trees, by the cliffs, by the  mountains,<br /> I catch sightings of hummingbirds<br /> orbiting her small head<br /> like fireflies.</p>  <p>Â (Published in <em>Matter </em>Issue 14 Animal)</p>
