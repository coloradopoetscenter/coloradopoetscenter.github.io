A launch.</p>  <p>One  can barely discern the rebellion of the skies,<br /> the  overture of lilies begins outside constellations <br /> of  rhetoric, the body count calligraphy.</p>  <p>Crescendo  and a vesper of whispers,<br /> arousal  and the crows oversee.</p>  <p> (Published in <em>Against Agamemnon: War Poetry</em> 2009)</p>
