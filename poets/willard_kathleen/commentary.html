          <h1>Critical Commentary          </h1>
          <p><em>&ldquo;First, there is the precision of the diction itself,  mimicking gently the precision of the flying machine. But within this precision  lurks a music. The ear of the poet hears consonants so sharply they sound as if  wind-whipped ropes, and the ease of the alliteration comes with surprising  gentleness. This is to say, at the level of word-craft, the poet pays real  attention. The words also speak meaningfully, seeking through history for that  human constant that makes of a wild-minded flying machine a realization not of  human folly alone, but the hope that accompanies folly. For all the potential  danger of knowing too much—&ldquo;And that is all we want&rdquo;—there is a humbler  realization always at work, one indebted to imagination, that undercuts the  poem&rsquo;s reach after wisdom with the more human consolations of our heretic  nature.&rdquo;</em></p>
