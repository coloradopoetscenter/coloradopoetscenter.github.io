  <h1>Theory of Flight, Circa 1709</h1>  <p><strong> <em> for  Bartolomeu de Gusmao</em><em></em></strong></p>  <p>There is something elegant about the early  aviator&rsquo;s <br />
theories of flight—<br />
airships fueled by alchemy<br />
of ether, an element extracted from the  atmosphere<br />
fixative of stars in heavens.<br />
Without ether, his flying machine remains  earthbound<br />
unable to lift off—</p>  <p>And that is what we all want<br /> to take flight like swallows, a dream so  common<br /> it bores our therapists,<br /> but we hunger to outsmart gravity,<br /> to feel our bones empty and hollow,<br /> to record for all time our first instant of  levitation.</p>  <p>And understand his madness and hope his  hypothesis<br /> ether attracts humans<br /> and inanimate objects to the sun<br /> after amber gathered in glass globes <br /> awakens  magnets to elevate his metal plated ship<br /> will actually pan out.<br /> But then, we look at his drawing from the only  surviving manuscript.</p>  <p>His airship seems improbable with bird shaped  sails,<br /> contraptions of pulleys and bellows,<br /> its underbelly of giant feathers and garish  flags,<br /> and still parts of his theory are credible <br /> as his first experiments flew unmanned through  Lisbon.</p>  <p>But wait, he burned his entire opus  <br /> seconds before fleeing soldiers from the  Inquisition<br /> for what mortal dares fly and trespass in  heaven?<br /> All of us, we are all heretics <br /> imagining ourselves winged and free.</p>  <p>(First Place Winner, Arapahoe Community  College Writer&rsquo;s Studio Literary Contest, 2012)</p>
