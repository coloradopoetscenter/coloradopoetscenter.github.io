  <h1>On the Road to  the Ghost City of Fatehpur Sikri </h1>  <p>I promise you, I will tell others your story<br /> and warn them not to stop on the road  from Agra<br /> to Fatehpur Sikir,  not to stop and take your picture<br /> even though among the Qualandrars, your  keepers,  <br />  your captivity is a profession passed  down from father to son.</p>  <p>  At  first, I am enchanted until I learn of your capture <br /> as a cub somewhere in the Himalayas,<br /> the piercing inside your nose, the  pulling through<br /> of a leather thong, your snout muzzled.<br /> So that today you sit on your haunches  by the side of the road <br /> as your master hustles<br /> tourist busses to stop. </p>  <p>  He  stands and raises a stick over your head<br /> and tugs at the leather leash until you  rise<br /> on two feet like us open your arms wide  and share<br /> the beauty of a white crescent moon  smeared across your chest.<br /> We do not stop and whiz by Korai, the  village of your captors,<br /> and are relieved when you are no longer  in sight.</p>  <p>  Left  to anticipate the splendors of Fatehpur Sikri, <br /> a royal city abandoned by a Mughal  emperor,<br /> we see further down the road<br /> bear after bear after bear.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>(Published in <em>Landscape and Place: An Anthology</em> 2008)</p>
