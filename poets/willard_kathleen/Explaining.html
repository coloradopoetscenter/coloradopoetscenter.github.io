          <h1>Explaining          </h1>
          <p>No picture postcard or silver bangle  bargained for in Jaisalmer,<br />
            no bright Rajastani puppet bought from a  retainer at  Mehrangarh Fort, <br />
            no folk songs heard fireside at the  Ossian camel camp,<br />
            no squeeze box, tabla, and wooden flute  riff<br />
            no stop at the mirrored temple to Sati  Mari, a &ldquo;local Hindu goddess&rdquo;,<br />
            no   city wide call for prayer at sunrise<br />
            or morning ragas at the Taj Ganges,<br />
            no astrologers by appointment only in  hotel lobbies <br />
            or bicycle rickshaw rides through the  streets of Delhi,<br />
            no sip of opium tea from the palm  of  a camel herder,<br />
            no   Sikh offering me a honey and wheat sweet after leaving his temple,<br />
            no circumambulating the stupa in Deer  Park, <br />
            where Buddha told his disciples the  Middle Path<br />
            and this century&rsquo;s pilgrims perform  prostrations, no monk offering <br />
            a fallen leaf from the tree that shaded  Buddha or wind dispersing <br />
            the silkscreened prayers of prayer  flags,  no circle of monkeys,<br />
            Hanuman&rsquo;s ancestors, expecting food and  offering blessings,<br />
            not even wrapping my body <br />
            in the lavender and gold brocade sari  against the outside world, <br />
            no tinkle of bells on the small girl  dancing for rupees<br />
            as her father plays the rawanhattha or  the boy running<br />
            on backwaters of Kerala waving, <br />
            no packs of wild pigs and wild dogs  eating in the mounds of trash <br />
            outside the Taj Mahal, <br />
            nor tents pitched on all roadsides, the  homes for many families, <br />
            or the girl balancing on the high wire  as her father beats a drum and her mother holds <br />
          the baby in her arms as tourists take  pictures          </p>
          <p>           will  ever complete the story.      </p>
          <p>I tell my friends I have come back from  India ---
