              <h1>Forgetting</h1>
              <h1> after Adrienne Rich</h1>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Resting on the sand are the shards of our faiths.<br />
                Yesterday the answer for our grief  emerged<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  herself out from a wave's break.<br />
                Like the surprise of a<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  newborn's gurgle, like we've never heard it<br />
  &nbsp;  before.<br />
                Last night I read another line by  Dickinson.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  She must have been fully aware of<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  everything she suffered<br />
                from a resurgence of the mindhand<br />
  &nbsp;  switch to the want for longing.&nbsp;  Her love graining<br />
                the years into the fragments<br />
  &nbsp;  we've come to collect.<br />
                And she kept it all until the last<br />
  &nbsp;  day, dashing her memory<br />
  &nbsp;  for the sake of the sands,<br />
  &nbsp;  holding questions in her hand<br />
  &nbsp;  and capitalizing tomorrows on Truth.<br />
                Her memory came from the same<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  source each morning.</p>
