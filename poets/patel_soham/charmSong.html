              <h1>A Charm Song for the Cherub</h1>
              <p>It's refreshing to think even<br />
                the cherry song has its red-stained  fugue.<br />
                What's a cherry song?<br />
                Ask the cherub &amp; while you're at  it, ask<br />
                why what matters does.<br />
          Then take his answer strolling home  with your smile.</p>
