title: Soham Patel : He wasn't hungry yet


---


<h1>He wasn't hungry yet</h1>
<p>He's been dubbing his kid memory<br />because it's always been fuzzed  anyway.</p>
<p>He wanted one more inch toward  certainty,<br />so he drew a highway landscape  illusion<br />  according to the rules of vanishing  math.</p>
<p>In the coin pocket of his blue jeans  was a lock of cat hair<br />waiting to serve as clouds for the  drawing.<br />The drawing would include the electric  fence that would remind<br />  him not to resort to the temper  tantrum option.</p>
<p>I heard his ear catch the echo of a  ring,<br />a bell hanging from the heifer's neck.<br />She had jumped the fence straight<br />  onto his round robin egg plastic  dinner plate.</p>
