              <h1>Blackberries west</h1>
              <p>My husband eats blackberries<br />
                out of our daughter's hand,<br />
                she has more palm lines<br />
                than could even fit<br />
                on my left hand.&nbsp; We've<br />
                moved as far west as we can<br />
                for the reason of<br />
                eating these plump pockets.<br />
                Juice making<br />
                of mouth<br />
                devour<br />
                of anything<br />
                even the<br />
                freezer<br />
          can hold.</p>
