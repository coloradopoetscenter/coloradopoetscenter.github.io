  <h1>Albany Winter</h1>
<p><i>After John Cheever&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Swimmer&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the foyer closet by the staircase,</p>
<p>he finds a silk scarf, smells the lingering</p>
<p>sweetness, tangerine and cream,</p>
<p>his dry fingertips snagging the</p>
<p>soft weave. He ponders the call</p>
<p>of a bullfrog by the backyard pool,</p>
<p>cannot believe it&rsquo;s gone, all of it,</p>
<p>nothing left except dust on windowsills,</p>
<p>a lonely, white scarf.</p>
<p>He blames himself&mdash;he coveted</p>
<p>too much for it to be good. She is far</p>
<p>away, the kids dispersed to distant gray cities,</p>
<p>the house&mdash;incredibly&mdash;is empty,</p>
<p>and he can see a time, years from now,</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;ll be old and so in love</p>
<p>with this moment that he&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>get up from the table and make tea, </p>
<p>whiskey or vodka too harsh. He&rsquo;ll sip hot</p>
<p>sweetness from an old mug, listen</p>
<p>to his grandfather&rsquo;s cabin creak</p>
<p>on a raw cold night. He will love</p>
<p>this moment only then, when he is old</p>
<p>and alone and lonely: the scarf against</p>
<p>his face, bitterness on his tongue, the taste</p>
<p>of emptiness. The wind will stamp outside,</p>
<p>night falling in a small window,</p>
<p>winter, the fields golden and dead,</p>
<p>just outside Albany, in the old house</p>
<p>with gravestones down back by the creek</p>
<p>in the shadow of a dormant willow,</p>
<p>his family name eroded,</p>
<p>but the strange skulls and wings</p>
<p>of death still clear, still indelible.</p>
