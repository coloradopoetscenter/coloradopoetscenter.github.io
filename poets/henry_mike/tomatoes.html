  <h1>Tomatoes</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a parapet looking down</p>
<p>at the upturned faces and those voices</p>
<p>rising up like feathers in an updraft. </p>
<p>I am afraid of heights, but I know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fall, and in the knowing my fear</p>
<p>is singed, my will is a skeleton hung</p>
<p>together by silver twine, on my cold wrists</p>
<p>there are bracelets, inlaid turquoise with silver,</p>  <p>hammered thin by a Hopi boy in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Arizona</st1:State></st1:place>,</p>
<p>a boy whose face is wide and soft, and he blinks</p>
<p>each time the small hammer strikes. </p>
<p>I once had a girl,</p>
<p>once lived with in gray air of her cigarettes,</p>
<p>her dark-paneled room. Her eyes gold-brown,</p>
<p>her face so finely wrought</p>
<p>like a kind of porcelain.</p>
<p>The way she brushed her hair down</p>
<p>across her scapula and vertebrae</p>
<p>left me weak and fearful, I thought I might turn</p>
<p>into a feather and float out of the room. She had</p>
<p>a friend whose name was Paige,</p>
<p>who had a mother</p>
<p>who did away with herself on the summer</p>
<p>solstice, four bottles of pills, she sat</p>
<p>in a chaise lounge near the garden,</p>
<p>by a thicket of tomatoes overgrown</p>
<p>and unkempt, heavy, red planets so full,</p>
<p>and Paige said every day that August she ate them</p>
<p>with a pinch of salt, she said they tasted</p>
<p>like nothing, nothing at all, like air she said</p>
