              <h1>From Highway Twelve </h1>
              <p>What time of day was it, pulled over<br />
                in North Dakota,  striking against monotony,<br />
                waking up in Montana,  making love on the Madison,<br />
          making love on Rock Creek, making love</p>
              <p>resonate in the hum of the engine,<br />
                in the rise of heat, in the breaking rush<br />
                of a late afternoon storm front collapsed<br />
          around the mountains? So that now,</p>
              <p>traveling back over the same roads<br />
                as if I am remembering the guilty pleasure<br />
                of being a passenger, a year of my life<br />
          occupies three days of driving.</p>
			<p>(<em>Touchstone, </em>Number 36)</p>
