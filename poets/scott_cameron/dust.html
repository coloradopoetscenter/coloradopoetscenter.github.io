              <h1>Dust </h1>
              <p>Chris emerges from beneath the rusty body,<br />
                picks a wrench from the ground,<br />
                disappears behind the hood. He spends<br />
                entire weekends covered in grease,<br />
                deep in meditation over the ailing bodies<br />
          that litter our front yard.</p>
              <p>During the week he drives them across town;<br />
                something always breaks&mdash;sometimes <br />
                he drives just to see how far he can get.<br />
          Some nights, I too think I can fix everything</p>
              <p>but really this is about the woman<br />
                who came up to me and Sol on the street today.<br />
                She said we both looked kind and generous.<br />
          She said she needed some gas money to get to Phoenix.</p>
              <p>If she had just asked me for money<br />
                I would have said yes, but instead I put my hand<br />
                on her arm, looked into her eyes<br />
          and shook my head. Dry waves of heat</p>
              <p>stop me in my tracks. There are three seasons here:<br />
                in love with the sun; been in the city for months<br />
          and finally left; sidewalks submerged like failed levees.</p>
              <p>I&rsquo;d like to tell you the current is strong enough<br />
                to carry everything away, but when the police helicopter<br />
                shines a light on a car tearing through a back ally or empty  lot<br />
          clouds of dust rise above the neighborhood in a giant eddy.</p>
              <p>I wanted to tell you I am sick of dust. It is inescapable.<br />
                I wanted to tell you it is not necessary.<br />
