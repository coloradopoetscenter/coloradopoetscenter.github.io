              <h1>River Lamentations </h1>
              <p> Of the undercut bank and the small side channels<br />
                and of all the bends and curves in afternoon light,<br />
                fish, but not on private property.<br />
                Of the rainbows, struggling with whirling disease,<br />
                catch, but release immediately back into the water.<br />
                Of the brown trout the color of summer wheat<br />
                and flecks of sunrise, and of all other trout with white<br />
                tipped fins, catch, release, and do not covet. <br />
                Of frozen cod and halibut, put them in your shopping cart, <br />
                but be aware the oceans are depleted; of the fish sauce <br />
                and other condiments, of tuna found in tin cans, <br />
                read the label, for trouble may be caught <br />
                and carried therein.<br />
                <br />
                And when you reach the place where the river splits<br />
                do not try to fish all three braids at once; <br />
                of any one you promise to take fishing, take fishing;<br />
                but if you are tired of your brothers, and have been<br />
                sitting on the couch for too long, quit your games<br />
                so you may submerge yourself in moving water.<br />
                <br />
                And if you are fishing your favorite run, or in a run <br />
                that holds some kind of intimacy, keep your breath slow<br />
                so that your heart does not run away with you.<br />
                <br />
                Neither raise up your rod and line to strike the water, <br />
                nor place your legs in the deepest currents, for that is an  abomination. <br />
                Yes, even when you have caught a large fish, pumping your  fist <br />
                and hooting are an abomination, and worthy of rebuke.<br />
                <br />
                Take your fishless days as they are given to you, neither  use them<br />
                to whine about life or to find solace in women, for that is not<br />
                what they are for; if you go out drinking beer and talking<br />
                about how good a fisherman you are, you will be sent away <br />
                from my presence, for there is no more room other than<br />
                that space made for Chinese or pizza or tamales.<br />
                <br />
                When you have finished, let the empty pint then remain upon  the table, <br />
          and do not spin it contemplating about lost love.</p>
