<h1>Around the Bend
</h1>
<p>We wonder, oh we wonder what&rsquo;s up around the bend,</p>
<p>on a lonely narrow cow path or a highway with no end.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re wondering what our futures hold,</p>
<p>on that ol&rsquo; home range we&rsquo;ve always rode,</p>
<p>or like drifters searchin&rsquo; for long lost gold,</p>
<p>a new treasure surely could unfold.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that special place.</p>
<p>It sings a song in an empty space.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>We just must hear this calling bird,</p>
<p>and know the song, its every word,</p>
<p>with this we hope the answers heard,</p>
<p>that will satisfy this searching urge. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ask a servant of the narrow road</p>
<p>to tell you what and how to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>But late at night he too will send</p>
<p>his question of a heavenly bend.</p>
<p>When each must meet the final end</p>
<p>or sing the songs of holy men.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Until we meet our maker it will always be this way,</p>
<p>asking questions about that yonder land.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The somewhere land, the unseen land,</p>
<p>that always sunshine cloudless land,</p>
<p>that never crying live forever land,</p>
<p>that land around the bend.</p>
