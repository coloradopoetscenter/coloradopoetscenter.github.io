              <h1>Lost Wax</h1>
              <p><em>Wherever  there was wax, there will be bronze.</em><br />
                <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---
              <p>It can make you laugh:&nbsp;  a giant foot on a flat-bed truck, <br />
                or a nose--as big as a refrigerator--sniffing under the red <br />
                light--holding it red longer than usual. And one hot night <br />
                in August, a fifteen foot head of Elvis was spotted making <br />
          its sultry way above the corn fields. Sculpture is no small </p>
              <p>thing, and the lost-wax method has been found again <br />
                in this Colorado  town where bronze was something&nbsp; <br />
                you did to baby shoes. And where are they going&mdash;<br />
                these castings of ourselves--these larger-than-lifes?&nbsp; <br />
                I imagine a smog-filled city calls up an order for a tall <br />
                bronze woman to pour unending buckets of cold water<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                into a pool where hot men sit smoking, sleeves rolled <br />
                up, where each day is like doing time. And I&rsquo;ve seen <br />
                a field in Syracuse  where thirty sculpted mothers writhe <br />
                with thirty separate griefs (a keening hieroglyphic:&nbsp; <br />
                arms and legs beseeching, bended, broke) <br />
                over the loss of their children from Pan Am Flight 103.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                And where does the lost wax go?&nbsp; Some say that like a soul <br />
                it slips away.&nbsp; It  cannot hold to form for long and when <br />
                the heat becomes too much, it leaves a space for memory <br />
                to pour itself a monument around. It is here we bring our <br />
                flowers.&nbsp; But at the  core, the hollow breath of wax remains <br />
                more fixed than bronze and tells of how it almost carried <br />
          to the sun a young and dreaming Icarus.</p>
