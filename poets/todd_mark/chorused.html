title:  A Chorused Flight of Birds

<h1>A Chorused Flight of Birds</h1><p>Startled aloft by clatter from the ground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they wheel and climb, globbed by an unseen force<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that crowds  them in a warping, flexing ball.<br />This harmony of sight requires no sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to guide their flock-together churning course,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to tell them  when to glide and when to stall.<br />The multitude, connected wing to wing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once joined, now flies apart  as the group aborts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the flight, dispersing, single in their fall,<br />their fluttered voice no longer massed to sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all.</p><p> (From the anthology, <em>Open Windows 2005,</em> edited by Matt Davis and  Sonya Unrein, Ghost Road Press, 2005.)</p>
