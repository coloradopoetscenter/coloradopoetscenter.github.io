<h1>Eclipse</h1>
<p> I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the numbered times I&rsquo;ve seen<br />the moon&rsquo;s arc, its flat medallion a traced<br />path across the canopy sky, its face<br />in two dimensions, like a spot-light beam;<br />or the thoughtless times I&rsquo;ve assumed its scheme<br />of things was merely a bright plate that effaced<br />the stars, a celestial disk too long encased<br />in the time-weary lines of a lover&rsquo;s theme.<br />But one still night, when the earth&rsquo;s shadow licked<br />away the moon&rsquo;s full milk-veneer, I stood<br />on the dark deck, and through a reddish trick<br />of light, it seemed a suspended world I could<br />almost touch, suddenly a solid place,<br />  a sphere that hung in the deep room of space.</p>
