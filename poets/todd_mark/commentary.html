<h1>Critical Commentary </h1>
<p>Dana Gioia, chair of the National  Endowment for the Arts, has this to say about Mark Todd&rsquo;s poetry: &ldquo;Todd&rsquo;s  perspective is not the urbanite&rsquo;s vision of a simpler country life but an exact  and exacting account of what rural life entails. His central theme is the  inhuman landscape, both the conflict and the concord of rural civilization and  wilderness. . . . He sets this confrontation and conversation of human  consciousness and the human world in the high mesas and mountains of Colorado, but the drama  he depicts is both universal and primal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike Nobles comments in the <em>Tulsa World</em> that Todd &ldquo;writes in a  manner that chronicles and respects the geographical region. At the same time,  his voice is so powerful that he transcends region and speaks to the heart,  regardless of where you live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And George Sibley, regional author  and journalist, writes in <em>Colorado  Central Magazine</em> that &ldquo;Todd is often looking, more or less  unapologetically, through the eyes of a newcomer seeking a way to break into  the local culture. The perspective, new and place-seeking, seems validated in  the quality and honesty of good poetry.&rdquo;</p>
