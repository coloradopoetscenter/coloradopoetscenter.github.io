title: Mark Todd : Tongues, Teeth, Knuckles 


---

<h1>Tongues, Teeth, Knuckles </h1>
<p> Fastened sleet sashes panes<br />and window-worlds outside,<br />where horses confront worse.<br />All night, their manes gathered<br />slush, wind-dreaded to hold<br />ice like tongues suspended<br />in syllables tinkling<br />bitter chill. A raw-boned<br />gelding lifts one front hoof<br />to batter into snow <br />while his other feet clamp<br />legs in narrow shadow.<br />The herd waits, enduring<br />winter teeth zippered tight<br />to February cold.<br />Behind them, breezes strafe<br />magpies, pushed to the ground,<br />gusts strong enough to count<br />striped knuckles on willow<br />  phalanges, clench by clench.</p>
