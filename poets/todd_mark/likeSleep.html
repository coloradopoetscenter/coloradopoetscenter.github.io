title: Mark Todd : Like Sleep, but Brittle


---

<h1>Like Sleep, but Brittle</h1>
<p>Like sleep, but brittle,<br />a film that crackles<br />from each toss to turn<br />and then returns<br />to the starch of wakefulness.<br />And still the moon stalks<br />across the floor, its snarl<br />a predation of light<br />ready to sink shafts of claw<br />into sleeping wood.<br />My shallow breaths<br />pull at the hours, each a gate<br />of brass and hinged shadow<br />that will not open <br />until the knock of time.<br />But a cat purrs warmth<br />into my back, kneads the ridges<br />of my spine with soft throbs,<br />as I drift, almost unaware, <br />  on the margins of a thin night.</p>
<p> (From the anthology, <em>Open Range: Poetry of the Reimagined West</em>,  edited by W.C. Jameson and Laurie Wagner Buyer, Ghost Road Press, 2007.)</p>
