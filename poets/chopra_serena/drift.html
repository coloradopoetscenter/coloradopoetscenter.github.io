<p></p> 

  <p>dawn,<br /> I hear love in your feet,14 times <br /> the density of water</p>  <p>the Earth was born, and dawn,<br /> no history is immune from ends </p>  <h1><strong>Continental Drift</strong></h1>  <p>Once it was thought that mountains were analogous to the  wrinkles of dried fruit. We know better now that our core is not shrinking,  rather, our cement is stacking. Stars blush in the nightlight and we know now  how Earth throbbed her plated skull and slip-crack crafted a peak; a semiotic  showdown for twin towers. Pikes of construction dirt echo the knuckled horizon,  urgent fingers tremble hands, muting eons; shifting is the yellow grass  buttering wind—A crane stretches, lifts its cable-hooked stone, a claw splits  the dirt, sounding the wide mouthed terrain.  </p>
