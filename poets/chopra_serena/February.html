          <h1>February</h1>
          <p>Swarming the roof fell caving and crawling the flames sunk  shattered glass and popping like ice raw blue-handed moon those screams were  for real relentless for real afternoon cravings for yellow pop-eyed birds:</p>
          <p>Her little bird bones quivered<br />
            I thought Iâ€™d crack<br />
            down in the orange alley light<br />
            although<br />
            it was morning<br />
            the sun could not see us<br />
            although the kisses<br />
            the cold tiles, the brutal <br />
            were all so light.          </p>
