  <h1>February</h1>  <p>Swarming the roof fell caving and crawling the flames sunk  shattered glass and popping like ice raw blue-handed moon those screams were  for real relentless for real afternoon cravings for yellow pop-eyed birds:</p>  <p>Her little bird bones quivered<br /> I thought Iâ€™d crack<br /> down in the orange alley light<br /> although<br /> it was morning<br /> the sun could not see us<br /> although the kisses<br /> the cold tiles, the brutal <br /> were all so light. </p>  <p>Published in <em>Umbrella  Factory</em></p>
