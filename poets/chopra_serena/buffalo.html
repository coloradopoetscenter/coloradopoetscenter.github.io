          <p>The train is saying. The train, if drifting. The train, an  iron blue. She collected water in hollowed-out bone and chased the sun with  glass. The fat-cheeked day sucked the cacti and splintered wood dry, and further  out, the hills swept up from the dust like the full cloak of a queen. When she  listened beyond the wind, Conti-Mare thought she could hear the pleasant  whisper of streams, and the green smell of leaves collapsed the thin cough of  the desertâ€™s breath. The tracks disappeared into the sand like the anchor of a  sunken ship. She knelt down to sniff the rust. <br />
            The train is saying. <br />
            The train <br />
            will come<br />
          upon a desert of ears.          </p>
