  <h1>Chalk</h1>  <p>One easily identifiable biochemical limestone is chalk.  Chalk is a soft, porous rock made up of microscopic marine organisms who gather  their secrets in deposits along the southeast shores of England. Long ago, in a  time of two moons and no stars, a woman named Woolf, after her love of secrets,  walked into the ocean and gathered fragments of chalk in her pockets. As she  emerged from the water, the chalk bled from her dress, streaming like long  fingers, white letters in the blue, midnight waves. One of the two moons caught  a glimpse, dropped his wave-harnessing reins, and stared with all his shine.  There he read a message for someone who could not answer. The moon searched for  the scribe with no avail, and just before taking hold of his reins, a howl  scattered the sky. The un-harnessed moon shattered and sifted like chalk into a  galaxy of a thousand stars.</p>  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Earth <br /> consumes  more <br /> than you <br />  can know</p>  <p>born in  4004 B.C <br /> a  tangled rhizome— </p>  <p>predicted?</p>  <p>—like  bird feet </p>  <p>Published in the<em> Denver Quarterly</em></p>
