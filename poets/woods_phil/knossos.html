<h1> Eating Watermelon at Knossos &nbsp; </h1>
<p> After finding a room near the Venetian </p>
<p> Cathedral meandered toward </p>
<p> bus stop. Being hungry, </p>
<p> thirty, spied </p>
<p> the open door of the truck. </p>
<p> Farmers selling peacock </p>
<p> green melons. Lips moistened&mdash; </p>
<p> the sweet flesh </p>
<p> of all rocky Ford melons of my youth. </p>
<p> Homesick no more, I thumped two </p>
<p> or three. Found a dandy. The </p>
<p> price so modest. Marched </p>
<p> away small one in </p>
<p> a pale blue bag.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> At oasis of a park </p>
<p> below the old fort wall, dug </p>
<p> in with short blade. </p>
<p> That wonderful </p>
<p> popping sound of exquisite ripeness. </p>
<p> Bending over I brushed </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &amp; spat the black eyes of cats on the </p>
<p> ground as juice dripped down </p>
<p> beard, over hands, arms. </p>
<p> No matter, the crimson meat was </p>
<p> delicious. I nearly yelled </p>
<p> my joy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Somehow managed to cope with </p>
<p> stickiness. Caught bus </p>
<p> to the home of the Minotaur. </p>
<p> Everywhere a vague </p>
<p> disappointment. Too tampered with.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Yet, a strange homecoming. Have I </p>
<p> always known this place? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I ate the other half by the entrance </p>
<p> while bored tourists stared </p>
<p> with eyes that said I was </p>
<p> undignified.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I felt a man. Natural </p>
<p> among the frightened &amp; dangerous civilized.</p>
