<h1> The Zodiac of Words &nbsp; </h1>
<p> Some words are spoken of </p>
<p> as though they were a whisper&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Some words are the wings of small birds </p>
<p> that fly out of the skirts of young women&nbsp; </p>
<p> Some words are like the daggers </p>
<p> of moonlight </p>
<p> that pierce the darkness of silent rooms&nbsp; </p>
<p> Some words are like the deep vowels </p>
<p> of old women chanting prayers&nbsp; </p>
<p> Some words are exactly like the lies </p>
<p> false lovers tell each other </p>
<p> on their way towards betrayal </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Some words are so delicate they </p>
<p> barely fit into your hand </p>
<p> Disappear without trace&nbsp; </p>
<p> Some words are like the snow </p>
<p> that sleeps in the memory&nbsp; </p>
<p> Some words are like stolen corn </p>
<p> eaten in the lost innocence of childhood&nbsp; </p>
<p> Some words die of their weight </p>
<p> like buildings so tired </p>
<p> they collapse of sadness&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Some words are like bread </p>
<p> being given to a dying leader&nbsp; </p>
<p> Some words are more hungry </p>
<p> than hunger&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Some words are the mask </p>
<p> the executioner wears </p>
<p> Two eyes &amp; no smile&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Some words are made up of so many </p>
<p> broken match sticks </p>
<p> they will never again make fire&nbsp; </p>
<p> And some words are like saying goodbye </p>
<p> in a train station </p>
<p>one has never been&nbsp;</p>
