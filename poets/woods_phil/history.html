<h1> What I Mean by History</h1>
<blockquote><p>(for Malidoma Some)</p>
</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> We are taking a journey together. </p>
<p> This is not just a class </p>
<p> And what I'm trying to give you </p>
<p> Is not just information. </p>
<p> We are spending time together. </p>
<p> To make it meaningful </p>
<p> Means we're both engaged. </p>
<p> When I tell you, you will have </p>
<p> A shallow sense of life and </p>
<p> A shallow identity if you </p>
<p> have no history, </p>
<p> I don't say this to make you feel bad. </p>
<p> I say this to intrigue you, </p>
<p> To whet your appetite </p>
<p> For the inner journey. </p>
<p> The journey to inner strength </p>
<p> Where you will have </p>
<p> The soul fire to weather </p>
<p> The winds of trouble, </p>
<p> The pain that touches </p>
<p> Every life. </p>
<p> Without connection to the living tree </p>
<p> We call the ancestors </p>
<p> Those winds will blow you over, </p>
<p> Knock you down, </p>
<p> Beat you to the ground. </p>
<p> I know! </p>
<p> I've struggled up many times. </p>
<p> Been knocked down again </p>
<p> Over and over. </p>
<p> Without that ancestral voice </p>
<p> Saying get up! You're not unique. </p>
<p> We were knocked down. </p>
<p> We got up so you could Be! </p>
<p> Without that voice </p>
<p> Living inside you </p>
<p> We are lost </p>
<p> And the game is up! </p>
<p> That's what I mean </p>
<p> by history!&nbsp;</p>
