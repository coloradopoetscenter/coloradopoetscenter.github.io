<h1> Ken Kesey &nbsp; </h1>
<p> I used to see him quite often, whiskey glass in hand at the Vet's club&mdash;the cheapest place to drink in Eugene, Oregon, in the early '80s. &nbsp;Now he's toasting beers with the &quot;Holy Goof&quot; who used to drive that rainbow bus &amp; our world far less merry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I only met him once at a lit party after he read at the university. </p>
<p> Just as he left he turned &amp; said to his wife: </p>
<p> &quot;Look at that man's hands!&quot; </p>
<p> Then to me: </p>
<p> &quot;Were you a wrestler?&quot; </p>
<p> &quot;Yes, I was.&quot; </p>
<p> &quot;I knew it,&quot; he said. Then he was gone.&nbsp; </p>
<p><em> Sometimes a Great Notion </em> changed an historian into an aspiring writer. I never got to thank him. by an autumn river I thank him now. it all goes too fast. Even magic buses rust &amp; Holy Goofs and Merry Pranksters move on.&nbsp;</p>

<p> <em> While I was living in Eugene an irresponsible young reporter printed a front page story implying that Kesey was under strong suspicion of being part of a major cocaine ring. The story was all innuendo &amp; unnamed sources. Ken made his own placard and marched all day back &amp; forth in front of</em> The Register Guard. <em>Soon, thereafter, perhaps even the next day, a reporter was out of work and an embarrassed newspaper printed a front page apology including photo of Ken and his placard. Even pranksters have their limits &amp; this one will be missed.</em>&nbsp;
