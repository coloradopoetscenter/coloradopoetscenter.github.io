<h1>The Buddha's Hand &nbsp; </h1>
<p> After many years I come back </p>
<p> to swimming. </p>
<p> In the water I feel </p>
<p> a buoyancy </p>
<p> seldom known in my everyday life. </p>
<p> Since the collective grief of 9/11 </p>
<p> I have observed as I turn my head </p>
<p> for breath </p>
<p> the cycle of the turning year. </p>
<p> the leaves have turned &amp; fallen away. </p>
<p> Stark branches &amp; low sun </p>
<p> have marked the onset of winter. </p>
<p> Slowly the light has returned </p>
<p> &amp; now, even the new green. </p>
<p> In all this time the water </p>
<p> has never failed </p>
<p> to carry my body </p>
<p> as the spirit carries the soul's </p>
<p> knowledge </p>
<p> that the body will fall away </p>
<p> &amp; something buoyant </p>
<p> that the water knows </p>
<p> will continue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> At those moments when </p>
<p> the mind </p>
<p> is free of thought </p>
<p> an oceanic sense of contentment </p>
<p> enters </p>
<p> &amp; leaves </p>
<p> with every breath </p>
<p> &amp; that which continues </p>
<p> is known </p>
<p> inside the knower </p>
<p> like an ancient embrace </p>
<p> first seen </p>
<p> in the gesture </p>
<p> of the Buddha's </p>
<p> upturned hand.&nbsp;</p>
