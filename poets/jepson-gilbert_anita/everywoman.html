<h1><strong>Everywoman </strong> </h1>
<p>harbors two hearts<br />one faithful and<br />wise as swallows<br />who return each year<br />to churches barns<br />to nest with mate and<br />brood solidly against the wall<br />shielded from shearing winds<br />the storms of chance<br /><br />but deep beneath the bones<br />encased and bolted tight<br />she bears another heart<br />flapping raptor wings<br />that ache for solitary<br />flight to scale the sky<br />to heights unknown<br />then plunge to earth<br />in wild pursuit.</p>
