          <h1>A Dead Language</h1>
              <p>                Her kitchen swells with the aroma <br />
                of garlic simmering in olive oil. <br />
                Humming to herself, my mother <br />
                slices mushrooms into tiny trees--<br />
                like perfect cutouts <br />
  from slabs of white marble. <br />
  She is making the tomato sauce <br />
  learned from her eldest sister--<br />
  interpreter for the other ten <br />
  because their mother did not speak English. <br />
  When I ask why all the children <br />
  didn't learn two languages, my mother laughs: <br />
&ldquo;It would have put the teachers to shame!&rdquo;<br />
  She wishes now she could have learned Italian, <br />
  those melodious secrets shared only<br />
  by mother, father, and sister. </p>
              <p>I also feel cheated. I learn to make the sauce <br />
                but without the stories of seasoned women, <br />
  without the wisdom of many grandmothers. <br />
  I am like these hot-house tomatoes, <br />
  without juice or sweetness, <br />
  born from sterile soil and shallow roots. <br />
  Today I long to know the names <br />
  of sausages and cheeses tumbling on my tongue, <br />
  of ancestors who cut marble and planted olives <br />
  near some village east of Rome. </p>
              <p>My mother's name sounds like an Italian love song--<br />
                Lumena Amoroso, but she was only known as &ldquo;Lou.&rdquo; <br />
  Hers was a song quelled by silence,<br />
  and none of her children will ever know the words.</p>
