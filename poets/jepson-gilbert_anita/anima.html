  <h1>Anima </h1>
<p>From roots thrust deep<br />as far as Ethiopia<br />she comes,<br />floating on her own breath.<br />She dances veiled in night,<br />retelling stories while we sleep.<br />Like pleated scarves<br />they unfold their gauzy tales<br />as we lie caught<br />between fear and death:<br />The lover sails away on lemon rinds,<br />pythons lie in wait beneath the stairs,<br />from crumbling roofs we fall to consciousness<br />with silent cries upon our lips.</p>
<p>Some say she hides the truth<br />under black light;<br />others, that she opens windows in the sky<br />and showers secrets from falling stars.<br />Banned from sacred houses,<br />she slips between stained glass<br />when the moon rises orange<br />and full of holy lies.</p>
<p>Most men fear her<br />except the few who hunger<br />for her breasts.<br />In desert caves <br />she suckles these<br />on fire and wind<br />and fills their mouths<br />with ancient songs.<br />Here they learn to paint<br />the empty chambers of the heart,<br />the canvas stretched tight<br />between the eye and the soul.</p>
<p>She alone endures the night,<br />disarming soldiers in the dark,<br />haunting all of us<br />from other wars<br />where phantoms breathe<br />from flesh so like our own.</p>
