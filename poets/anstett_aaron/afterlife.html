<h1>Afterlife</h1>
<p> Perhaps the four-color photograph of a lube stop and car wash, </p>
<p> like a heaven above the numbered days and months of a giveaway calendar, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> is heaven and shall be our dominion forever, with glare on the glass doors </p>
<p> and lettering spelling something. Maybe the man with indistinguishable features </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> standing on a sidewalk runs things, and those driving vehicles somewhere </p>
<p> for eternity: heaven's emissaries, the interrupting angels, who veer </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> from this to that world. In the few scraps blown in after the asphalt was swept </p>
<p> and the pyramid of mortared cannonballs in the park off the highway, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> where the swings hang absolutely still, as if painted there, we find our joy always. </p>
<p> And there, on the photograph's left edge, the birds eternally arriving. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
