<h1>Gulf Coast 
</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;Heck,&quot; I said, hallucinogenic in Texas City, Texas, </p>
<p> a whistle stop like many days without sleep, the vapory, striated air </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>combustible and wobbly, the sheen of refined fuel dizzying. </p>
<p> God knows what awfulness-on-the-earth all-told </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> the colossal, flaring lean-to's on the edge of town were home to. </p>
<p> We ate fried oysters and cole slaw. Our glasses of beer stood yay tall. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Passersby in the windowpane wore expressions </p>
<p> like those on the faces in abnormal psychology texts, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> eyes blackened for anonymity but not reprieve from their distress. </p>
<p> They walked around as if undressed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> We sat undermined by substances. The tape loop of my blood </p>
<p> spun. I saw through my closed eyelids </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> afterimages of Heimlich charts, opened them and read </p>
<p> a government-issue poster: <em>WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF CHEMICAL</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> interrupted by her pale, halter-topped bare shoulder, </p>
<p> in which I more sensed than saw the entourage of atoms </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> shimmying on their hinges. Some outsized cloud of toxic gases </p>
<p> any moment might have risen like a drastic jellyfish. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I said, &quot;Heck.&quot; We paid the bill and took our chances. Many ambulances </p>
<p> hurried through the sun's last, almost acrobatic light. At the motel, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> atoms did their rope tricks. Hands and knees in the bathroom, eyes </p>
<p> inches from the tile, I whispered, &quot;Look here.&quot; </p>
