<h1>Good Morning</h1>
<p>Fifty-some years after the war, a kamikaze lands in my yard, </p>
<p> gently, like a sheet of newsprint. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Ohayo gozaimasu,&rdquo; I say, though it is evening, light grown ochre </p>
<p> and pink, day disappearing across the Zero&rsquo;s wings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> He shinnies from the cockpit, the thinnest man I&rsquo;ve seen. </p>
<p> He has evaded the radar. He&rsquo;s fallen </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> for decades, believing he&rsquo;ll attack </p>
<p> the coast of America, setting all the pines in Oregon blazing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I take him inside, where he drinks a glass of water. </p>
<p> It is clear. It tastes nothing like the ocean. </p>
