<h1>Answer
</h1>
<p> For which you'll study the debris-strewn intersections </p>
<p> and stricken faces your remaining days, may they lengthen, </p>
<p> as if some grain of disaster still hovered there, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> and you, having isolated it, work at an antidote. </p>
<p> Guesses you hazard: capsule of powdered glass, treatment plan </p>
<p> by which squad lights widen irises, and everything seen </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> through them thereafter shines. In this shimmer, </p>
<p> you develop your theorem of a fixed measure </p>
<p> of suffering, that there is now no more or less torment</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> than was or will be, but it wanders. Here a woman </p>
<p> is hurt with pliers. Here the killer watches a comedy. </p>
<p> You call it <em>No Accident</em>, and it sustains you, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> even thrown through a windshield, stones in your mouth, </p>
<p> even when you drift, combing each tatter of newsprint for what? </p>
<p> Winning numbers? The blazing script of your own name? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> You glimpse it in footprints, whatever direction, in road signs </p>
<p> and outdoor advertisements, especially in the eyes of animals </p>
<p> frightened at night: the startling liquid that washes us </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> ceaselessly, grasses springing back at each step. </p>
<p> Something, you know, is not forthcoming. Something, </p>
<p> like God, is everywhere but hidden, like skin under clothes. </p>
