title:  Fever Pitch Tent

  <h1>Fever Pitch Tent</h1>  <p>The howling wind nearly carried us<br /> Over the stubborn campfire<br /> With twigs caught in its bustle and fuss,<br /> Whisked though sere mangrove,<br /> Twisted, dry roots and coarse briar,<br /> To shrub grass coating the hills above.</p>  <p>Animals, living and dead, pressing<br /> Against our tent, kicking the careless<br /> Sortment of bags and bottles dressing<br /> The illegal ash pit danced their derision:<br /> Not scampering game in our headlights, but fearless<br /> Totems of roaming id.  So, lying as in prison,</p>  <p>Huddled together as we were,<br /> Each chest against the other,<br /> Linking the fire of clear<br /> Youth, we defied the exposure of dreamless<br /> Heads in a noisy veil.  Unable to smother<br /> The fire outside, we knit into seamless</p>  <p>Bulwark the rutted rock<br /> We lay on.  Having fought<br /> And laughed, hungered and sung, having gawked<br /> At slopes and swifts that clutch<br /> Life at its stitch to taut<br /> Flesh membranes, we knew the coming touch</p>  <p>Of dawn would break the storm into dew drops<br /> On earth, whose pores, cleansed by mist,<br /> Would reabsorb spirits of this ancient land.<br /> Knowing our skin would save us all, we slept.</p>  <p>Â© Uche Ogbuji 1995</p>  <p>[First appeared in ELF: Eclectic Literary Forum, 1995]</p>
