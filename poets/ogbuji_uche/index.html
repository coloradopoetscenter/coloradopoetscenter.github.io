              <h1>Uche Ogbuji</h1>
              <p><a href="http://uche.ogbuji.net/">Uche Ogbuji</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/uogbuji">@uogbuji</a>)  was born in Calabar, Nigeria. He'd lived, among other places, in Egypt and  England, but never anywhere longer than 3 years in his life until he came to  Colorado. Here he was instantly smitten by the mountain landscape and cultural  flavor, and he has now settled near Boulder with his wife and four children.  Uche is a computer engineer and entrepreneur whose abiding passion is poetry.  His poems, fusing Igbo culture, European Classicism, U.S. Mountain West  setting, and Hip-Hop influences, have appeared worldwide. His short collection  of poems <a href="http://uche.ogbuji.net/ndewo/"><em>Ndewo, Colorado</em></a> was  published in 2013 by Aldrich Press.</p>
              <p> Ogbuji  is editor at <a href="http://wearekin.org/"><em>Kin Poetry Journal</em></a> and <a href="http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/"><em>The Nervous Breakdown</em></a>.  He is also founder and curator of the<a href="http://twitter.com/ColoradoPoetry">@ColoradoPoetry</a> Twitter project. He is also a  founding member of <a href="http://stanzamassive.tumblr.com/">the Stanza  Massive</a>, a small, DIY-minded group promoting members' books of  poetry, including through collaborative, multimedia experiments with their  texts. Ogbuji blogs at <a href="http://copia.ogbuji.net/">Copia</a> and in his spare time snowboards,  coaches and plays soccer, and trains in <a href="http://www.coloradokenpokarate.com/">American  Kenpo</a>.</p>
