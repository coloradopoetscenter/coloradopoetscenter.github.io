          <h1>Growing up Misfit</h1>
          <p>To belong? What’s it mean? Is it creature of tense? Is it active or passive?<br />
            Is it cold set in bone, magma oozing to plate ocean floor, or explosive<br />
            Crackling reaction, plume clearing to flesh jacked into the massive?</p>
          <p>My parents were wartime romance. “There was something in the air that night,<br />
            The stars were bright, Fernando…” For liberty indeed, and ten years prior, NOT<br />
            Fernando; to ditch the justice of the peace and priest’s decree of might makes names right;</p>
          <p>They’d fought the Queen so that Gerald could be Uche, raised on Nigerian playgrounds<br />
            But when ancient wounds opened and national grass ran red, they fought for…Biafran greens.<br />
            Never thought that they could lose so they stitched their winnings into my ten birthweight pounds.</p>
          <p>Dry pod full of jumping seed, my parents burst into staggered menage.<br />
            Tied on mother’s back, I soaked in English, Igbo, Umon, Efik,…On to Cairo, badinage<br />
            In broken Arabic and shards of Europe; rickety tower for a babbler to manage.</p>
          <p>Camoflage tongue can get into trouble on any patch; bored in Cleveland school,<br />
            Smart-alec kid fresh from England lights a life-long beef with teachers in snotty fuel,<br />
            Acting like: “You chalkboard jockey, I’m too crazy-smart for you to fail.</p>
          <p>“My Dad’s a rising superstar engineer and who the hell might you be?”<br />
            So they worked the kick-that-badass hustle on my grades, and Dad came by<br />
            To mop up.  Off to St. Ann’s; nunnery license to ruler-smack if I dared disobey.</p>
          <p>Private tuition sits heavy on new immigrants, so when our move to Gainesville<br />
            Gave me a clean rap sheet, a Thurgood Marshall bus ride would soon reveal<br />
            That this was no Biafran playground: “Uche? Your parents called you that for real?”</p>
          <p>“You related to Kunta Kinte? Go steal me a bird from Chicken George<br />
            I ain’t got no money for KFC.”  Didn’t take much chameleon sense to judge<br />
            That I had about no time flat to crack the social code; find a signature to forge.</p>
          <p>My best friend and neighbor, bright, Jewish fellow-misfit struggling to conform<br />
            Tempted me to cruelty, showed me enough of the outline for me to frame,<br />
            To serve him, quick vic for sly betrayal when it came time to step up my game.</p>
          <p>I’d learned too smart was mistake, so: “Dad, do I have to go to gifted class?<br />
            Two times a week right before recess?  That shit’s going to mend my ass!”<br />
            But I knew deep down that was straight up bitch. I had my could-be-worse case…</p>
          <p>Hussein’s family had fled Iran in retreat from the Ayatollah muhajideen<br />
            But became the yard’s only-good-one-is-a-dead-one once the hostage crisis went down.<br />
            Hussein had seen worse than punk clique kids.  He was like: “Bring that shit on!”</p>
          <p>Tetherball terrorist, he ruled any game, throwing down on even eighth grade fools.<br />
            I wanted some of that juice, but I dared not cross the line—I knew the rules.<br />
            Even from across the yard, Hussein taught me the kind of misfit that keeps it real.</p>
          <p>My instinct turned to Hussein, but wasn’t ready; I’d become part of the colony.<br />
            Any chameleon can color redneck.  I cranked Charlie Daniels and AC/DC with the boys,<br />
            Bumped Sugar Hill Gang and Jackson 5 when there was no one to report the felony.</p>
          <p>Shot BB guns and wrist rockets, learned karate, skateboarding, whatever fit the bill,<br />
            Decorated the float when the Hurricanes came to town (Gator pride, y’all.)<br />
            Explored sewers by Hogtown Creek; pretended them Cowboys were kings of football.</p>
          <p>“Bam!”  I don’t even remember the goodbyes, the flight, just a blue-green streak<br />
            Then Jimmy Cliff singing “this is the land of my birth” on the car radio speakers<br />
            As we crossed the river Niger into the halved yellow sun, and I mixed back into my stock.</p>
          <p>But not quite.  Hope, pride and industry crackled from every radio, TV and politricks bullhorn;<br />
            Attitude to match from every soul I met: “USA?  That’s where you’ve been?<br />
            Watch and learn.  In a few years you’ll find God’s country right where you were born”</p>
          <p>“Ajebutta” was the pidgin for someone returned from where common sense and life skills<br />
            Run in short supply.  I was Ajebutta supreme.  All that work to tip the social scales<br />
            In Gainesville. Now this.  I was tired. I gave up, played it Hussein, and straight off the rails.</p>
          <p>Even this was not Biafra.  The enthusiasm and intensity told in my parents’ proud exile<br />
            Were ruthlessly watered down into “One Nigeria”.  We’d waited, but we couldn’t exhale.<br />
            Uche was a common name, but I couldn’t pinch myself into the common style.</p>
          <p>Seniors beat me up for insolence; prefects gave me hours of menial fag<br />
I brushed it off and stood hard! B-boy! no matter how often flogged; <br />
            Lied, stole and skyved, hunchbacked, lugging my removed self in a dirty bag.</p>
          <p>A bag that became my bastion, piled high with books beyond curriculum.<br />
            Nothing more important than craft of self expression, writing a column<br />
            To future brethren of taste and trait, distant twin souls of raffia and vellum.</p>
          <p>When your eyes learn to look beyond state, to peers beyond infinity,<br />
            Okigbo, Villon, Pound, Plath, sometimes you forget that misfit can grow to vanity.<br />
            I’ve come to grow into readiness for company, the scent and crinkled space of shared humanity.</p>
          <p>Collage is completion from gestalt-spackled gaps, pieces that never fit, that itch.<br />
            These rub away their corners into the circle of the whole.  They don’t match,<br />
            They mate; their seed elaborates the daisy chain, fit and unfit bait and switch.</p>
          <p>So I’ve grown to spread peacock tail.  I choose you—not to match, but to mate.<br />
            I’m your Gregor Mendel muse, your chameleon genome hot date.<br />
            Witness the fitness.  Witness the sticky space where misfits meet.</p>
