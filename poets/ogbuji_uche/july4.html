          <h1>July 4th at Arapahoe Basin</h1>
          <p>Massifs of the divide cut into delicate<br />
            Sky with their gnomic, craggy brown.<br />
            <em>Settled deep into Colorado's legend.</em><br />
            I look out from this million year old crown.</p>
          <p>The wizened dignity of ice patch streaks<br />
            Ignore the upstart clouds of matching white.<br />
            <em>Settled deep into Colorado's legend.</em><br />
            What mythic zero summer at this height!</p>
          <p>The titan expanse below is tempered<br />
            By tall thickets of scrabbling, hard won green.<br />
            <em>Settled deep into Colorado's legend.</em><br />
            What is the magic engine of this scene?</p>
          <p>The hardy terrain is symbolized by scree<br />
            Baring its loose tooth shards of angled grey.<br />
            <em>Settled deep into Colorado's legend.</em><br />
            What mountain gris-gris ghosted me away?</p>
          <p>The noon angle of high infinity<br />
            Dons a body of hot flame, unfiltered blue.<br />
            <em>Settled deep into Colorado's legend.</em><br />
            Set in the god-aged fastness of this view.</p>
