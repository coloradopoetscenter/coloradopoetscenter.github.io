  <h1>El Cabeceo de Niwot</h1>  <p>Whirl with me in this flatiron shade,<br /> Spin yin-yang teardrops of our hips,<br /> All limbs in strophe and antistrophe:<br /> Firm as pine roots, supple as tulips.</p>  <p>Sway with me to the downslope winds<br /> Tight to my rope cinched at silk mast<br /> Of your bodice, our spread-sail canvas<br /> Disdaining the stormy forecast.</p>  <p>Trip with me to the tumbleweed turn,<br /> Our steps like seed-bearing branches,<br /> Through restless legging of ''corrido''<br /> And strains of Chalino Sánchez.</p>  <p>Vals with me to divide of bedrock,<br /> Springs falling away upon both sides,<br /> Even the moon in wax and wane<br /> To fortnight beat about our Ides.</p>  <p>Flow with me along St. Vrain creek,<br /> Mingling with the Poudre and Cherry;<br /> We are the sweet-laden South Platter<br /> Bobbing refreshment to the weary.</p>  <p>Romp with me through this foundling land<br /> Sing your songs in our shared creole--<br /> They're listening, those dancing bears,<br /> Those elks engaged in caracole.</p>  <p>© Uche Ogbuji 2011</p>  <p>[Selected for presentation by the Poetry in Motion project of the Boulder International Fringe Festival, 2011]</p>
