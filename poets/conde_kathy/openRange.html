              <h1>Open Range after the Death of a Friend from a Drug Overdose</h1>
              <p>The September sun breaks over the rim<br />
of the Breccia Cliffs to crack the night.</p>
              <p>Frosted glass clover shatters<br />
                beneath my boots, echoes <br />
          off a northern stand of lodgepole pine. </p>
              <p>Sharp smells of woodsmoke and salt block <br />
                hang like slivers of ice on the air <br />
          thaw in my raw throat. </p>
              <p>I taste salt, close my lips<br />
                as warm air in my lungs collides with cold.</p>
              <p>The huge gray corpse of a jack pine <br />
                leans toward the cabin. </p>
              <p>The corral looks lonely and frozen <br />
                lost in remembering <br />
                the heavy suck of hooves<br />
          in the muck of yesterday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Horses hide in the far<br />
                corner of the pasture, heads low,<br />
          cold noses touching.</p>
              <p>Beyond them, Poison Bench lies<br />
                like an innocent dog at the feet<br />
                of cliffs where cattle die young<br />
          gorging themselves on sweet purple larkspur.</p>
