title: Kathy Conde : India Your Blazing


---



<h1>India Your Blazing</h1>
<p>India, your blazing <br />
palette pulsates over bodies <br />
of women in saris. <br />
Cotton and silk<br />
the color of passion<br />
shock our sleeping<br />
Western minds.</p>
<p>What is this fire<br />in your heart, India? This heat<br />of compost everywhere,<br />these burning bodies of the dead<br />filling the air<br />with ochre smoke,<br />this hunger smoldering <br />  through generations.</p>
<p>Your black-haired children,<br />whose cries scorch the night<br />while we sweat in our beds,<br />crowd around us in the streets<br />by day, their hands <br />outstretched as if to say&mdash;<br />Baba, pull me from these flames.<br />It's enough to burn our own <br />  pale complaints to ashes.</p>
