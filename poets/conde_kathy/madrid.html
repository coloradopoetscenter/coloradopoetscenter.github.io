title:  Morning in Madrid

<h1>Morning in Madrid</h1>
<p>Trees sway like gypsies dancing <br />in the fall breeze that sweeps <br />down the Paseo del Prado.<br />Birds bathe in the fountain of Apollo.<br />Madrid, compassionate city, soothes us&mdash;<br />me with my budding American mind,<br />homeless immigrants asleep on the grass,<br />tourists crossing a sea of red flowers,<br />a white-haired local man resting <br />on a park bench reading the daily news<br />like a wonderful fiction (he's beyond<br />care and his city agrees with him).<br />The cool breeze spins a spectacle <br />of leaves around the feet of Spaniards<br />who stroll across car-clogged streets.<br />Time moves like a monk along avenues<br />where trees dance flamenco, where<br />winged bronze bodies poise for great<br />flight from the tops of buildings,<br />where water slips like history<br />  around Apollo's marble feet.</p>
