<h1>Unwanted Waking</h1>
<p>You go along thinking<br />
your life is a rerun,<br />
an old black-and-white,<br />
but then you notice<br />
a lump in your breast.<br />
First you cry.<br />
You want the rerun<br />
back not this new<br />
scene where you act<br />
like every cup <br />
of coffee you make <br />
could be your last.</p>
<p>You see your breast<br />as never before&mdash;<br />soft like your life, <br />heavy like your heart.<br />You want so much<br />  to salvage it.</p>
