<h1>Organ Failure</h1>
<p>When my grandfather drew his last breath<br />he turned to my mother&rsquo;s pink face, her beehive<br />prom-hair. He whispered fire, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing<br />  as a friend mijita.&rdquo; His heart then gave out.</p>
<p>And life is like his heart, all fat, all grease,<br />pink flush, love-hate. He was raised on menudo <br />tripe and burned tortillas. Friends swarmed him.<br />Their honey need forever hurt him before the stings,<br />  before he lost his soul in their factories.</p>
<p>He sold grapefruits in a wooden stand;<br />his daughters sold eggs along dusty streets.<br />And I am learning the hero&rsquo;s dry soul,<br />the way hot sand darkened the streaks of his tears.<br />How he&rsquo;d cure the wasps. My sister stung<br />on the cheek, running, wailing. An image transfixed,<br />  was it all foreshadow?</p>
<p>It is how a hand reached forth in full youth draws back,<br />how some dogs run themselves thin believing in the win.<br />Does age make us brittle? Is it mostly the poor<br />  who grow cranky as unsoaped leather?</p>
<p>Was it beauty? Adonis&rsquo; blood flowering the snow?<br />When my friend&rsquo;s liver gave out she had d grown thin<br />and selfish as any drone! How death carries a fifth-<br />  grade pout, and the body cramps half-glorious.</p>
<p>The poor buy their way to aloneness.<br />I can hear the organs give out in rooms<br />where white walls echo as seashells.<br />Nurses scurrying to some future jet-plane vacation.<br />And the body a shell of liquid, swells, sways,<br />  forgets to know.</p>
<p>To turn an ear, forgive a world afraid?<br />Her body grows cold. To give a melody<br />of yellow roses, a poem, my breath, only<br />then would I shy to hold a thinning body.<br />I am, as it is, too young and arrogant<br />  to forgive or know.</p>
