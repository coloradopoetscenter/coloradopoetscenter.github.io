              <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
              <p>&ldquo;In <em>Pity the Drowned Horses</em>, Sheryl Luna  carves out of the El Paso landscape the music of the borderlands, where loss  and acceptance converge like the jagged bodies of the U.S. and Mexico: &ldquo;I long  for the grimy heat, / the Rio Grande&rsquo;s shallow passage, / the blue desert, and  the slick legs of runners / along the smoggy highway.&rdquo; Hers is &ldquo;the way to  truth,&rdquo; but such truths can be costly: &ldquo;And I am dry as an American can be.&rdquo;  Luna exquisitely captures&mdash;like no other poet before her&mdash;the &ldquo;unsung positive  capability / of the desert;&rdquo; her syntax&mdash;sometimes raw and edgy&mdash;creates a  tableau where everything rushes toward &ldquo;our wild need&mdash;all sweat, all shiver.&rdquo;  The overall effect is simply mesmerizing: &ldquo;Even the moon offers its solace like  a lover / that will never leave.&rdquo; (Robert Vasquez: author of <em>At the Rainbow</em>) </p>

              <p> &ldquo;In her opening poem, Luna declares that &quot;pain is  living and living is pain,&quot; but while she relentlessly probes the  hardscrabble lives of many of America's  Latinos, these poems aren't grim reading. They're transfigured by this debut  author's extraordinary lyric power.&rdquo; (<em>Library  Journal, c</em>opyright 2005 Reed Business Information. </p>
