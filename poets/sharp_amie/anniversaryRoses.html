  <h1>Anniversary Roses</h1>  <p>They&rsquo;ll fade soon, vigor <br />  deserting them one at a time </p>  <p>for a hereafter of charred red. <br /> A few more days of this purchased </p>  <p>life, then their frail necks <br /> will collapse and we&rsquo;ll gather </p>  <p>the petals in a bowl. Even today, <br /> bright with survival, certain  petals </p>  <p>are ridged with dark and one stem <br /> has begun a soft tilt. For now,  they strain </p>  <p>below for water and above for  sunlight, <br /> their undersides lit with brief  flame.</p>  <p>(originally  appeared in <em>The 2River View</em>)</p>
