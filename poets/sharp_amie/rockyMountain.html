</ul>  <h1>Rocky Mountain Sonnet</h1>  <p>Fall up into a windowless vault of  sky,<br />
where voice cannot relate Colorado&rsquo;s  blue.<br />
The tundra will need decades to  undo<br />
the harm if your foot strays onto  frost. Sigh<br />
at vastness clouded thousands of  feet highâ€” <br />
Long&rsquo;s Peak, a slate citadel  staring through<br />
the rotary of hours as the mist  accrues<br />
around the aloof crest. Watch the  wind&rsquo;s cry</p>  <p>lure billows into a gray mass,  thread the chill<br /> of winter through the eye of June,  a surge<br /> that overpowers daylight. Sparks  drill<br /> granite, shining in your eyes.  Blink to merge<br /> gray with sapphire and gape,  exposed, until<br /> you realize: lightning strikes are  final as words.</p>  <p> (originally appeared in <em>The New Formalist</em>)</p>
