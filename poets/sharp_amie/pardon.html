              <h1>Pardon</h1>
              <p>I.</p>
              <p>He&rsquo;s feared one thing all his  life.<br />
                The prisoner shuffles ahead,<br />
          clatters his leg-irons.</p>
              <p>Beside him, a silvered preacher  whispers.<br />
                Staccato clip of shined shoes on  flecked tile&mdash;<br />
          a guard knelling last steps.</p>
              <p>II.</p>
              <p>The ceremony prepared, <br />
                an electric hum fills the room,  droning <br />
          against another sound&mdash;he&rsquo;s  trembled </p>
              <p>in its wake for years. His breaths  catch<br />
                in the humid air: a ragged respite <br />
          from the surge of his fears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>III.</p>
              <p>The faucet stops its spill, and in  the stillness <br />
                he masters himself: he is the one <br />
          who has asked for this sacrifice. </p>
              <p>But in his water-terror white  knuckles grip <br />
                the metal basin&rsquo;s sides before <br />
          surrender, an immersion into  dread:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><em>In the name of the Father,</em><br />
                  <em>the Son,</em><br />
                  <em>and the Holy Spirit,</em><br />
                  <em>I baptize you </em><br />
                  <em>for the remission </em><br />
                <em>of your sins . . . .</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In a spluttering resurrection it  is finished.</p>
