          <h1>Riverwater</h1>
          <p>Suppose the angels laid <br />
down their flaming swords, <br />
weary of guarding all those <br />
gleaming gates, the blocked <br />
avenues of paradise, bitten<br />
fruits banishing us into an oasis<br />
of free will and sin. Outcasts, <br />
we&rsquo;ve learned to be generous <br />
even in our falling. Dying&rsquo;s<br />
our destiny, sure, but killing&rsquo;s<br />
our most stalwart talent—<br />
shrapnel shredding limbs, <br />
blood impossibly coagulating <br />
on busy streets. So suppose <br />
no one took up that mission <br />
and we all waited for death <br />
to track us simply through  arteries <br />
and years. Old bullets embedded <br />
in concrete bunkers, virgin <br />
bullets poised in magazines—<br />
we could wrench these <br />
into spring air, meld them<br />
into interlaced vessels perfect<br />
for scooping up riverwater<br />
and ladling it over some ordinary<br />
tree&rsquo;s thirsty roots. In our guilt<br />
and innocence we could marvel <br />
at the smoothness of metal, <br />
disband the phalanx assaulting <br />
the garden. Those steadfast angels <br />
could forget about justice <br />
and exile, rub the eternity <br />
out of their starlight hallelujah <br />
eyes, and go for a nice walk.  </p>
