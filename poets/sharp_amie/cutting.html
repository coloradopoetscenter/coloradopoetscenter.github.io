</ul>  <h1>Cutting Down the Old Growth</h1>  <p>March has ended once more.<br /> In Tennessee the trees are gowned <br /> with light green, in Washington <br />  cherry trees sparkle white-pink </p>  <p>parasols. Here the mountain <br /> crevices still glow white, stale  sky <br /> shining behind clouds tinged <br /> with gray. Blind to the calendar, </p>  <p>the cold parches grizzled brush, <br /> and small green globes among <br /> the roots drowse. This time last  year <br /> the sun burned bright, tepid gusts </p>  <p>pummeling us while we sawed <br /> rubbered wood, breaking the veined <br /> Russian sage, cutting back the  sedum <br /> with its hollow branches bent </p>  <p>like straws. We bore armfuls <br /> of wintered husk, remnants of  herbs<br /> that grew and died and will grow <br /> again for love of earth and sun. </p>  <p>Today the air, cold and wet, <br /> surrounds us with pinpricked <br /> slivers of moisture, but we spot  crocus <br /> blooms poking tiny curled fans </p>  <p>through the soil, latecomers  following <br /> their southern and eastern  siblings <br /> into the light. I don&rsquo;t believe  it, <br /> but spring is  coming like a swan.</p>  <p>(originally appeared in <em>US Represented</em>) </p>
