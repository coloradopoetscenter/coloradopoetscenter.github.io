              <p>Cloud saturates the shoreline air<br />
                        and  damply feathers the water.<br />
                        <br />
                        Only  at this vaporous edge <br />
                        have  I seen the horizon expand to a place <br />
                        <br />
                        where  nothing meets mist so zealously.<br />
                        I  want to learn the breadth of oceanic shadings&mdash;<br />
                        <br />
                        the  temperature changes aquamarine <br />
                        demands  before it frosts into blue. <br />
                        <br />
                        There&rsquo;s  no fathoming the domain <br />
                        these  sailboats gently bob over.<br />
                        <br />
                        Above  the planed landscape, <br />
                        the  mountainous clouds&mdash;<br />
                        <br />
                        sole  ambassadors of the vertical&mdash;<br />
                        drop  heaving shadows on an indifferent sea.<br />
                        <br />
                        What  secrets I&rsquo;d learn if I could only <br />
hold a wave&rsquo;s  small star of light in my eyes.</p>
