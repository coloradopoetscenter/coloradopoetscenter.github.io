title: Rawdon Tomlinson : Fat People at the Amusement Park


---


<h1>Fat People at the Amusement Park</h1>
<p>They are laughing at the rest of us,<br />amused at being here<br />  among bright lights and whirling things</p>
<p>laughing, despite their particular knowledge<br />of gravity, which is why they ride<br />the fastest and highest rides,</p>
<p>a release from the demands of earth<br />between bouts with blue cotton candy,<br />stuffed bears and peanuts&mdash;</p>
<p>we watch them bounce along the midway<br />with their rosy-cheeked smiles and jouncing<br />asses, chattering as though they'd entered</p>
<p>the kingdom, they step into the cars<br />of the tilt-a-whirl, tilting, and take off<br />into a scream of weightlessness.</p>
