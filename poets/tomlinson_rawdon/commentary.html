title: Rawdon Tomlinson : Critical Commentary

  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p align="left"><strong>For <em>Deep Red</em></strong><br />
&ldquo;Richard Hugo had said: &nbsp;'for lines are really the veins of men / whether men know it or not.' &nbsp;The same might be said of Rawdon Tomlinson's impressive book <em>Deep Red</em>. &nbsp;It is testament to the fact that authentic poetry simply can't be faked. &nbsp;It must always cost. &nbsp;It must always hurt a little. &nbsp;It must manage somehow to be, like <em>Deep Red</em>, that most difficult paradox: &nbsp;beautifully human.&rdquo;&mdash;Jonathan Holden, University Distinguished Professor/Poet-in-Residence, Kansas State University.</p>
