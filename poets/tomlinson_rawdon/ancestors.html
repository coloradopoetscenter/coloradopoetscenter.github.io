  <h1>Ancestors
</h1>
<p>They stand in front of the big fenders<br />And headlights, bulbous chrome grille<br />With Indian chief hood ornament<br />Which lights up in the dark.</p>
<p>In the background is a magnolia tree<br />And part of a house, a clothesline strung<br />Across gray space; a black and white<br />Bulldog sits at their feet</p>
<p>Making its smudged face of teeth.<br />Each thing is in its place:<br />Nothing worried about their eyes,<br />No problem with belief.</p>
<p>They're confident about the truth,<br />Sporting short fat ties<br />With gold watch chains hanging from vests<br />Of white, baggy suits&mdash;</p>
<p>Yet nothing says they're aloof or braggart.<br />Things are in their places:<br />The dime cigars they hold spoofing; spats<br />Shined&mdash;parts known by heart.</p>
<p>The women are inside the house<br />Finishing the chicken;<br />The thin one married to the son<br />Still dreams of being a nurse,</p>
<p>And doesn't talk much to the other<br />Who married again for fun.<br />At church they sang and took communion<br />This bright, airy Easter,</p>
<p>And now they'll go for a ride in the country,<br />And eat chicken under<br />Some big oak at the edge of a pasture,<br />And everything will be</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty as a picture,&rdquo; set<br />With only a cloud or two<br />Drifting across a spotless sky,<br />Everyone forgets . . .</p>
<p>The lean years behind; the children<br />Growing up strong, knowing<br />Right from wrong; and business booming&mdash;<br />A time sweet as Eden:</p>
<p>The fields of wheat like a table run<br />Smooth and green to the horizon;<br />And the cows graze painted<br />Into the blue air and sun.</p>
<p>The Kodak clicks, and they sigh out<br />Breath, joking, ready<br />To go, as the women emerge from the dark<br />Screen door in big hats,</p>
<p>With picnic basket, mocking a gesture<br />Of impatience; the engine starts,<br />Dresses are smoothed and doors shut&mdash;<br />No one knows who took the picture.</p>
