  <h1>My Mother Going Blind Sees the World </h1>  <p>1.<em> Paper Wasp Nest as Creation</em></p>  <p>A pointillism painting, I tell  her, this half-globe of stalk and brood comb I've found with its star points  glittering like braille beneath the loft light of a love. </p>  <p>Do you see, she asks me, how like  these wasps we too were born in the time of fern, fish creeping one extended  fin after another into the unstoppable moment?  </p>  <p>Imagine: birds, winged and  flute-boned, traveling past the tight hot cells of our own making, while  that tree of paradise  </p>  <p>(do you see the woman's hand in that  garden pulling it down--the lost, ignorant world?) </p>  <p>vanishes like  the woody earth masticated into this nest, layers of it like striated wind,  the  blind larval ones  murmuring at the wasps'  feet. </p>  <p>Time, then, she says, like the  hoar frost that stuns, sent even the Eve of us rooting like a hog into the  loamy soil, into the stump black with god's decay, to sleep</p>  <p>— our human bodies,  forsaken, mortal now, circling like chaff through the new raw air. </p>  <p>2. <em>Rock with Barnacles as Grief</em><br /> <br />  I think, my mother says, we are a  people alive as if foresaken on a windowsill, our stone hearts like these  barnacles—volcanic  ruptures—taken from  some perfect sea to perish, here.</p>  <p>The glass pane reflects her. I  can feel its coolness, the whole blind cliff of my mother's life here.<br /> <em>Try to cover your shivering  shoulders,</em><br /> the Russian poetRatushinskaya  once said. </p>  <p>With what?  I know my  mother will ask me.  The salt of seas,  the brine of tears?  </p>  <p>She wrote her poems on prison soap, I tell her, each washing  of her body proof of the heart's slow return to the visceral world.  </p>  <p>I once rode the wild trees, my  mother says, the eye of a distant sea, its storm rains sweeping over me, its  salt that hurt me, cast off, shed like a coat I can still push my arms through, <br /> <br /> white and pitiful in the dark. </p>  <p>3.  <em>Twine  as Loss</em></p>  <p>We try to seal it in, my mother  says, whatever frail vessel loss gives us to bring into stasis--a lost child,  an unopened book, an eye that doesn't see.</p>  <p>Before us, Pandora's box trembles  its closed mouth—inside,  I want to tell her, even hope before the blind beseeching bird, even hope  before the pale arm raised as if in flight. </p>  <p>Alone, my mother tells me, I knot  in an instance, ride the air like a wild lost river.<br clear="all" />  </p>  <p>4.<em> Origami as Death</em></p>  <p>A great dusk  spirals like black paper over the sun.  <br /> I am the folds of windmy mother tells me  <br /> the crane <br /> stepping  down the lonely river.</p>  <p>Her wings tip toward the stars<br /> her feet  <br /> <br /> (I'll tell her soon) <br /> delicate twigs </p>  <p>sinking into the earth<br /> into the flesh of everything.</p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>  <p align="right">(Honorable  Mention in the 2008 Joy Harjo Poetry Contest, published in <em>Cutthroat: A Journal of the Arts,</em> Spring 2009)</p>
