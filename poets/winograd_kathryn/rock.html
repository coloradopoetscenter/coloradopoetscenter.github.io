  <h1>Rock with Barnacles as Grief</h1>  <p> I think, my mother says, we are a  people alive as if foresaken on a windowsill, our stone hearts like these  barnacles—volcanic  ruptures—taken from  some perfect sea to perish, here.</p>  <p>The glass pane reflects her. I  can feel its coolness, the whole blind cliff of my mother's life here.<br /> <em>Try to cover your  shivering shoulders,</em><br />  the Russian poetRatushinskaya once said. </p>  <p>With what?  I know my mother will ask me.  The salt of seas, the brine of tears?  </p>  <p>She wrote her poems on prison  soap, I tell her, each washing of her body proof of the heart's slow return to  the visceral world.  </p>  <p>I once rode the wild trees, my  mother says, the eye of a distant sea, its storm rains sweeping over me, its  salt that hurt me, cast off, shed like a coat I can still push my arms through, <br /> <br /> white and pitiful in the dark.</p>
