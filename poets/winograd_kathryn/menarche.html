  <h1>Menarche</h1>  <p>I think of the eggs that hung  beneath <br /> My childhood  pond reeds, the cyclical <br /> Water moon-pulled through their  fine membranes <br /> Waiting to tear. And how you  came, my tiny <br /> Amphibians, torn from my womb  sac, <br /> Your eggs perfect, intact, even  then <br /> Like galaxies numerous beyond  our backyard <br /> Stars, that <em>Full Long Nights Moon</em>, <em>Wolf Moon</em>, <em>Moon</em><br /><em> Of  the Red Grass Appearing</em> lighting you up already.</p>  <p>Dark fish of your eyes, moon in  the window, <br /> I held you, said, <em>Here</em>, still say these thirteen <br /> Years, the garden opening once  more, <br /> And each flower hanging above  the late <br /> Blown snow—my soon winter and  your spring—<br /> Gone to seed sock-eyed and  skull-headed, <br /> The air sweet and sweet.  <em>Dark of  the Moon</em><br /> And you shedding your first  wise blood. <br /> Thinnest now, they say, between  the Holy <br /> And you, and no sorrow, not  now, not now.</p>  <p> published in <em>Calyx</em></p>
