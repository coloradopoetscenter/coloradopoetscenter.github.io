  <h1>Paper  Wasp Nest as Creation</h1>  <p>A pointillism painting, I tell  her, this half-globe of stalk and brood comb I've found with its star points  glittering like Braille beneath the loft light of a holy love. </p>  <p>Do you see, she asks me, how like  these wasps we too were born in the time of fern, fish creeping one extended  fin after another into the unstoppable moment?  </p>  <p>Imagine: birds, winged and  flute-boned, traveling past the tight hot cells of our own making, while  that tree of paradise  </p>  <p>(do you see the woman's hand in that  garden pulling it down--the lost, ignorant world?) </p>  <p>vanishes like  the woody earth masticated into this nest, layers of it like striated wind,  the  blind larval ones  murmuring at the wasps'  feet. </p>  <p>Time, then, she says, like the  hoar frost that stuns, sent even the Eve of us rooting like a hog into the  loamy soil, into the stump black with god's decay, to sleep</p>  <p>— our human bodies,  forsaken, mortal now, circling like chaff through the new raw air.</p>
