<h1>The Gift </h1>
<p>It was not what it could be, but what it was I wanted&mdash;</p>
<p>That horse like a pendulum stilled </p>
<p>Between the faint blue ridge </p>
<p>Of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, <em>Blood of Christ</em>, </p>
<p>And the dust of the Arkansas Valley,</p>
<p>Sage-run, plucked by a north wind </p>
<p>Toward slow spring. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A philospher once said it:</p>
<p><em>In the true meadow of the soul, </em></p>
<p><em>Only asphodels grow</em>, and so only sadness,</p>
<p>Those fields for the dead. </p>
<p>How could I explain it, my daughters, mine,</p>
<p>Standing there, and already my darkest waters,</p>
<p>Or nothing so definite, </p>
<p>Steering me?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Grief of love then &mdash;</p>
<p>That head tied to a rusted trailer, </p>
<p>The horse standing there hump-withered, </p>
<p>Head-bowed, all clavichord </p>
<p>And brae of bone, wing of spindly rib, <em>love,</em></p>
<p>What I could hardly dare finger </p>
<p>This many years past, and, suddenly, </p>
<p>This haggard drum of skin </p>
<p>Be-whiskered, shit-carved. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Of course they did not want it&mdash;</p>
<p>My girls all hot-blooded for totem </p>
<p>And winged deity, courier of the gods, dark effigy </p>
<p>Blown freehand some thousand years past on cave walls&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>All this sex, of course, yet unnamed by them still,</p>
<p>Even as they dream (as I know they dream): </p>
<p>The slender stems of their bodies </p>
<p>The wind strums </p>
<p>Balancing over the willful, beating heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
