          <h1>Origami as Death</h1>
          <p>A great dusk  spirals like black paper over the sun.  <br />
            I am the folds of wind   my mother tells me     <br />
          the crane<br />
         
          stepping  down the lonely river.</p>
          <p>Her wings tip toward the stars<br />
            her feet  <br />
            <br />
            (I'll tell her soon) <br />
         
          delicate twigs </p>
          <p>sinking into the earth<br />
            into the flesh of everything. </p>
