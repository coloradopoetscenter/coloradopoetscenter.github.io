  <h1>Twine as Loss</h1>  <p>We try to seal it in, my mother  says, whatever frail vessel loss gives us to bring into stasis--a lost child,  an unopened book, an eye that doesn't see.</p>  <p>Before us, Pandora's box trembles  its closed mouthâ€”inside,  I want to tell her, even hope before the blind beseeching bird, even hope  before the pale arm raised as if in flight. </p>  <p>Alone, my mother tells me, I knot  in an instance, ride the air like a wild lost river.</p>
