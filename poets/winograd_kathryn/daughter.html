              <p class="style1">A word is elegy to what it signifies</em></p>
              <p class="right"> Robert Hass </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> You teach me <em>eye</em> and <em>arm</em>, your hand cradling </p>
              <p> The weighted base of this microscope. </p>
              <p> A careful, slow turning of power, this, </p>
              <p> And at your touch a miniscule slice of frog </p>
              <p> Muscle transforms into clear facets </p>
              <p> Of <em>rubies</em>, I say, the new world already </p>
              <p> Naming itself into the bearable. </p>
              <p><em> Do you see?</em> you ask me, catching now </p>
              <p> A nail scraping of onion between wedded </p>
              <p> Glass, my terrible nightly weepings </p>
              <p> Dissipating into thin paper </p>
              <p> As I squint one-eyed down the eye tube </p>
              <p> Into light, nudge the first apparent nothings </p>
              <p> Into the torn edges of onion, now </p>
              <p> The illuminated epidermis-- </p>
              <p> Those soldierly cells with their black dots, <em>eyes</em>, </p>
              <p> I think, of this translated nuclei </p>
              <p> Littering the dear and visible world </p>
              <p> With our dreams of <em>sphere</em> and <em>stem</em>, <em>word</em> and <em>tear</em>.</p>
