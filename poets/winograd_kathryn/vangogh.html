          <h1>Van Gogh’s  Saint-Rémy </h1>
          <p>            <em>To try to understand the real significance  of what the great artists, the serious masters, tell us in their masterpieces,  that leads to God. </em><br />
          <em>            --Van Gogh,  Borinage, December, 1878</em></p>
          <p>How what’s beautiful blazes—<br />
            A drooping star,<br />
            An ochre sunflower <br />
            Crackling beneath its old glaze. <br />
            I stood in your room in Saint-Rémy, <br />
            The anguished bed stiff <br />
            On its points of lead, the obligatory <br />
            Desk as blank as canvas. </p>
          <p>The world had already turned. <br />
            North light blazed all night <br />
            In my rented window. <br />
            Stars washed the horizon <br />
            Of villa stone. <br />
            Those I loved slept, the small fig <br />
            Of my heart withering—<br />
            As if baptismal, the tears <br />
            Unending, the wall of myself<br />
            Descending as yours did, <br />
            That painted cypress of<em> The Starry Night</em> <br />
            Kindling funereal<br />
            In the foreground of your Holy.</p>
          <p>Everywhere the light <br />
            Draws us past stone,<br />
            Past the wood shutters the wind flings—<br />
            The world carved and delirious <br />
            Beyond me, beyond you whom I see <br />
            Half listening now<br />
            Amidst a concavity of iris, <br />
            Of sea swirl, the poppy mad <br />
            For such utter destination. </p>
