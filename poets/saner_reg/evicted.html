<h1>Evicted Bikini &amp; Crewcut</h1>
<p>Which August? The one we were evicted </p>
<p>onto Liguria's <em>Costa Azzurra</em>&#8209;&#8209; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>where in our tiny beach cottage bed&#8209;loft</p>
<p>you lounge nude and read and eat grapes</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>and I love it? A bikini, a crewcut</p>
<p>out of the Sixties, our last summer alive</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>as young couple&#8209;&#8209;in snapshots that've aged</p>
<p>too beautifully. Toward an erstwhile jock </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>not yet a bookworm this his luminous girl </p>
<p>slim enough now to be your own daughter </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>still comes wading ashore, comic Venus</p>
<p>in sea weed she's letting drool down</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>over her own wet tresses and nose burn, </p>
<p>while sun burning on water shows two</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>happily frowning into the lens, no idea</p>
<p>they're more than good looking, clueless</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>how good those looks could become.</p>
