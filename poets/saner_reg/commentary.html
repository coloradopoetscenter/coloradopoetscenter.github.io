<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Reading <em>Climbing into the Roots</em> I wondered how many more lovely poems are waiting for poets to find and put down. Saner has widened the range of possibility, has increased all our chances. It&rsquo;s a beautiful book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Richard Hugo</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saner&rsquo;s is not an easy optimism, it&rsquo;s a courage that comes from facing up to grief and loss, from stepping out of the self and acknowledging the <em>otherness</em> of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-Susan Wood, <em>Houston Chronicle</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear images that demonstrate man&rsquo;s unseverable link to nature . . . as an informing presence, and end in itself rather than a consolation prize. Saner&rsquo;s verse has the clarity and crispness of that theme.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em> - Booklist</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . a voice whose calm and humor and sincerity inform poetry that is powerful and strong and self-assured: intelligent, manly in expression, and never oafishly macho.&rdquo;</p>
<p> -Tess Sullivan-Daly, <em>Worcester Telegram </em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The overall effect . . . is an exhilarating tension of the sublime and the ridiculous, of gravity and legerity expressed in evocative, hard-won, carefully marshalled language. </p>
<p> - David Young, <em>Field </em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Saner&rsquo;s maturity appears both in the breadth of his vision and in the sureness of his technical command. . . . muscular energy plays throughout the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - Louis Martz, <em>The Yale Review</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;No mere descriptive poet, his book no Field Guide, Reg Saner&rsquo;s poems are about the process of knowing the world, about its mysterious reflection of depths within us. To mistake him for a naturalist would be to miss the refined power of his meditative Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - J.D. McClatchey, <em>Poetry</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;His real concern is with man&rsquo;s position and role with respect to nothing less than the cosmos. . . . Saner is one of those few poets in whom we can see a reflection of the actual knowledge of today.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - Peter Stitt, <em>The Georgia Review </em></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same National Poetry Series as Larry Levis&rsquo;s book and Michael Ryan&rsquo;s <em>So This Is the Map, </em>chosen by Derek Walcott, begins with their premise&ndash;that wisdom may be unattainable. But Saner&rsquo;s more intricate craftsmanship, and more generous vision, produces a book with something to say. . . .&rdquo; </p>
<p>- Mary Jo Salter, <em>Washington Post</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Saner seems to speak from a depth beyond emotion and reason&ndash;a third place, where desire and logic no longer struggle, and grace enters. Not simple felicity, but grace in the old sense.</p>
<p> - Joe Hutchison, <em>The Bloomsbury Review </em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Saner is not an idle poet of nature. Like Wendell Berry, he . . . writes of challenging the land, looking to learn man&rsquo;s right relationship to it, and, in the process, establishing a dialogue that is as humbling and instructive as that between man and God.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - Fred Smock, Louisville <em>Courier Journal</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Though description is his forte, Saner&rsquo;s inventions are often strangely moving, even when his personal terrain is not immediately accessible.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - ALA <em>Booklist</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;By far the best [of the five books] is Reg Saner&rsquo;s <em>So This Is the Map, </em>by a meditative, philosophical poet concerned with the good old questions&ndash;why are we here? where are we going?&ndash;and with finding a language for them in the elements, in earth, air, fire, and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - Nicholas Bromwell, <em>New Boston Review </em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Like all original poets, he seems to have created a style free from of the contemporary traps. . . . This is an important and superb book and it belongs in every library with a poetry collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - Brendan Galvin, <em>Choice </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em>&ldquo;Saner uses a line with more subtlety and power than do most poets, combining the short, biting line with a longer lyrical line that carries his richly varied cadences. He&rsquo;s not afraid to be difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - Sam Hamill, <em>American Book Review </em></p>
<p>&ldquo; . . . when one takes into consideration the thematic daring and range of <em>Essay on Air</em>, its expansive of style becomes as appropriate and necessary as it is inspriing. . . . Reg Saner is one of our most important originals.&rdquo;</p>
<p> - Peter Stitt, <em>The Georgia Review</em></p>
