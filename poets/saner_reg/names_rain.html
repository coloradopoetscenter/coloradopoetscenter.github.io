              <h1>Names of the Rain </h1>
              <p>&ldquo;A real <em>gully washer</em>,&rdquo; say farm folks,</p>
              <p>ranch hands, and we feel the flood. </p>
              <p>So too in the silent life of sound, </p>
              <p>words like <em>cloudburst, sun shower, </em></p>
              <p><em>downpour, drizzle, </em>and<em> mist </em>brim wetness</p>
              <p>weather itself seems to be speaking. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p>To which hydrology adds names of its own. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p><em>Fossil water </em>lives underground, </p>
              <p>an aquifer, a lake with its eyes closed, </p>
              <p>whose droplets when sky-divers </p>
              <p>were water <em>meteoric</em>. A desert shower </p>
              <p>made strange is <em>virga</em>: ghost rain </p>
              <p>never quite touching down. But if to fall </p>
              <p>seems half of all that water does</p>
              <p>the other half is rise, </p>
              <p>since one time or another old ocean </p>
              <p>has gone everywhere, been everyone. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p>So coral lagoons set sail in rose cloud </p>
              <p>turning to snow drawn up by patriarchs </p>
              <p>of Idaho forest. A witty friend slips away, </p>
              <p>re-ascending as larkspur or spruce--</p>
              <p>which may explain my being so taken </p>
              <p>whenever a high-country stream </p>
              <p>refills my canteen in rain&rsquo;s truest name, </p>
              <p>its fast unanimous surge, all brilliance </p>
              <p>and blur and bright side-trips</p>
              <p>that never forget how to be water.</p>
