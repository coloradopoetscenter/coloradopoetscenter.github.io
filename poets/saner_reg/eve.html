              <h1>Eve &amp; After</h1>
              <p>No sooner had the apple tasted Eve </p>
              <p>than the whole garden fell in love </p>
              <p>with her frailties, </p>
              <p>improvising faults of its own </p>
              <p>as if hoping thereby to grow </p>
              <p>that mortally beautiful. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p>And Adam? From the low simplicity </p>
              <p>of sleep he entered Eden for real</p>
              <p>only as he woke to light </p>
              <p>and was told her name, whose touch</p>
              <p>became his favorite surrender.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Though the garden's been dust </p>
              <p>such a long while now </p>
              <p>that none of it's true any more, </p>
              <p>Adam still loves daydreaming back</p>
              <p>to his every imagined perfection</p>
              <p>last seen alive in her smile.</p>
