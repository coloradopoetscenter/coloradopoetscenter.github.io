<h1> Valley of Ashes </h1>
<p> The morning light is frail as the stalk </p>
<p> of a lily, greenish, as if ready to droop </p>
<p> back into night and put out the sun. </p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve traveled all the way from my lush </p>
<p> valley in Wales, a miner&rsquo;s daughter </p>
<p> and now a miner&rsquo;s wife, staring out </p>
<p> the doorway at desolation, not a tree </p>
<p> or anything green as far as I can see, </p>
<p> only rows of unpainted shacks, just </p>
<p> a step between front stoop and dusty, </p>
<p> dirt street, gray as a layer of ashes </p>
<p> in the feeble dawn. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Back home, our company bungalows </p>
<p> were built of native stone, our valley </p>
<p> ringed by mountains, wildflowers </p>
<p> dotting the green meadow grass </p>
<p> with a dozen colors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> As I watch the woman across the road </p>
<p> scrub clothes on a big washboard, </p>
<p> I begin to cry. </p>
<p> My two little girls are asleep, oblivious </p>
<p> to the dirty light, the stretch of gray streets </p>
<p> that will flow with mud in the spring. </p>
<p> They don&rsquo;t yet hear the mine&rsquo;s </p>
<p> machinery grating out the minutes, </p>
<p> or the sound of cloth rubbed vigorously </p>
<p> against corrugated metal. </p>
<p> When they awake, I&rsquo;ll plait their hair </p>
<p> without ribbons and dress them in gray, </p>
<p> as I begin to teach them to live without color. </p>
<p> I will teach them not to miss trees, </p>
<p> tender grass or flowers. </p>
<p> They will learn to love their gray dresses </p>
<p> and the landscape of dirt, gray rock and brush. </p>
<p> They will learn to see beauty </p>
<p> in a diatom on a lump of coal, </p>
<p> or a dust phantasm </p>
<p>rising in a sudden wind.
</p>
