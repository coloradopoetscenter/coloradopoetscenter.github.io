<h1> Before the Cataract Operation </h1>
<blockquote><p><em> after Lisel Mueller </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> I&rsquo;ve heard it said that Claude Monet </p>
<p> refused the very operation I&rsquo;m soon to have. </p>
<p> They&rsquo;ll cut away the thickened lenses </p>
<p> on my eyes, that blur the outlines </p>
<p> of my instruments and measuring devices, </p>
<p> and turn the colors of the garden liquid, </p>
<p> fantastically melding hue into light </p>
<p> in just the way a painter might desire. </p>
<p> I, myself, am secretly reluctant to lose </p>
<p> this view of a world without dimensions </p>
<p> and boundaries, formulas turned to hieroglyphics, </p>
<p> charts and graphs become unruly as abstract designs. </p>
<p> No wonder Monet wanted to preserve a vision </p>
<p> of reality so alien to science, yet so filled </p>
<p> with surreal and glorious metaphor: </p>
<p> gas street lamps as angels, the Rouen </p>
<p> cathedral built of shafts of sun, </p>
<p> the meeting of sky and water indistinguishable. </p>
<p> I stop myself from thinking of a world </p>
<p> blurred into loveliness. </p>
<p> I am a scientist, not a painter. </p>
<p> I will go forward with the surgery </p>
<p> that will restore the sharpness of my vision </p>
<p> and my singular way of looking </p>
<p> upon the complex objects of my work.</p>
