<h1> Radium Girls</h1>
<p> We sat at long tables side by side in a big </p>
<p> dusty room where we laughed and carried </p>
<p> on until they told us to pipe down and paint. </p>
<p> The running joke was how we glowed, </p>
<p> the handkerchiefs we sneezed into lighting </p>
<p> up our purses when we opened them at night, </p>
<p> our lips and nails, painted for our boyfriends </p>
<p> as a lark, simmering white as ash in a dark room. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Would you die for science?&rdquo; the reporter asked us, </p>
<p> Edna and me, the main ones in the papers. </p>
<p> Science? We mixed up glue, water and radium </p>
<p> powder into a glowing greenish white paint, </p>
<p> and painted watch dials with a little </p>
<p> brush, one number after another, taking </p>
<p> one dial after another, all day long, </p>
<p> from the racks sitting next to our chairs. </p>
<p> After a few strokes, the brush lost its shape, </p>
<p> and our bosses told us to point it with </p>
<p> our lips. Was that science? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I quit the watch factory to work in a bank, </p>
<p> and thought I&rsquo;d gotten class, more money, </p>
<p> a better life, until I lost a tooth in back </p>
<p> and two in front and my jaw filled up with sores. </p>
<p> We sued: Edna, Katherine, Quinta, Larice and me, </p>
<p> but when we got to court, not one of us </p>
<p> could raise our arms to take the oath. </p>
<p> My teeth were gone by then. &ldquo;Pretty Grace </p>
<p> Fryer,&rdquo; they called me in the papers. </p>
<p> All of us were dying. </p>
<p> We heard the scientist in France, Marie </p>
<p> Curie, could not believe &ldquo;the manner </p>
<p> in which we worked&rdquo; and how we tasted </p>
<p> that pretty paint a hundred times a day. </p>
<p> Now, even our crumbling bones </p>
<p> will glow forever in the black earth. </p>
