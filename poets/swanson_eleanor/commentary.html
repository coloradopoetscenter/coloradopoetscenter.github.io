<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p> Ellen Bass finds that Swanson&rsquo;s &ldquo;graceful&rdquo; collection gives us a glimpse into Curie&rsquo;s &ldquo;fierce devotion to science&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;unforeseeable consequences&rdquo; of her work&mdash;&ldquo;issues which continue to be urgently relevant today.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Poet and Nobel Laureate in chemistry Roald Hoffman says of the book: &ldquo;The waypoints of Marie Curie&rsquo;s life have long been known; what Eleanor Swanson does is to take us by her sure poetic hand and lead us into feeling. In this cycle of touching poems, Marie Curie lives.&rdquo; </p>
