<p>#1<br />My wife says, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write me<br />  romantic poems? You might get laid...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing down realistic poems,<br />  like what you&rsquo;d actually say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s disgusted, &ldquo;I hope you make<br />  good friends with your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing that down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  #2<br />Walking down the street,<br />I'm massaging her neck,<br />which she&rsquo;s audibly enjoying,<br />but just as a woman walks by she cracks,<br />
&ldquo;You're just hoping to get laid.&rdquo;<br />The woman glances over,<br />grins and breaks into laughter!</p>
<p>#2.1<br />His hand says to her warm hip,<br />
&ldquo;I know what to do with you.&rdquo;<br />Her eye smirks,<br />
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what to do with me!&rdquo;</p>
