<h1>Iris remembers her first time</h1>
<p>She&rsquo;s thinking back<br />to the pretty blonde girl&rsquo;s brother<br />  </p>
<blockquote><blockquote>  <p><em>&mdash;then she was nearly twelve, I was ten,<br /> the time we slipped away<br /> far from the party&rsquo;s crowded pool&mdash;</em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br />while she focuses on the lines <br />around her wide brown eyes,<br />lengthening her lashes, <br />rouging olive cheeks dark as lips,<br />glossing lips stoplight red<br />like melting plastic <br />under hot mirror lights,<br />but she wants this cruelty&mdash;<br />she&rsquo;s so angry.</p>
<p><br />  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted me to be there in the barn<br />  though I was still scared of sex<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because girls had exclamation marks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of dicks&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when this blond boy just wanted to,<br />she wanted me to watch<br />but I looked far away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as much as I could,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smelling the dry fields,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dung, the bats, and her&mdash;<br />her hair&rsquo;s tangled thicket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against her flimsy perfumed dress.</em> </p>
<p><br />She focuses on her lines<br />holding an aluminum chair for balance<br />as each leg stretches<br />and turns out softly opening,<br />one extends straight back <br />through heel, ball, toe into <em>pointe</em>,<br />glides into a lift,<br />the strength-move<br />making her lycra string costume disappear&mdash;<br />but it&rsquo;s hard as rope everywhere.</p>
<p><em>It looked like a deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flower in the fields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there was a mushroomy smell (his?)<br />and sounds like long kisses <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a wet sponge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its depths so good <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;both of them groaned weird&mdash; <br />it&rsquo;d blossomed like a mouth<br />and sour milk puffed out of him;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she laughed like <br />he&rsquo;d told the funniest joke<br />and he nearly smacked her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his blue eyes cold as sky. </em></p>
<p><br />She focuses on how to flow<br />under the thirsty lines-of-sight,<br />braces her queasy stomach,<br />clenches up her insides to go on<br />as if there were a reason to,<br />as if there were love <br />instead of cash<br />reaching up to pull her strings...</p>
<p><em><br />She&rsquo;d still think of him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even when we played in the basement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where it smelled like laundry and dough&mdash;</em><br />  </p>
<p>And when she&rsquo;s gone deeper into herself<br />she&rsquo;s surprised by the mirror wall <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where her hands, her arms spread<br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expressing so much yearning</p>
