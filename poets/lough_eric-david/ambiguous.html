              <h1>The Ambiguous Region</h1>
              <p>Floods and delusions in paradise</p>
              <p><em>in nomine patris et filii et spiritus santi</em></p>
              <p>the loss of a new arrival<br />
                among the Babylonian style  rebellion</p>
              <p>the find is sealed with a kiss<br />
                and new friends lag like nomads</p>
              <p>the candlestick house is a <br />
                delicatessen</p>
              <p>choosing the right candle for  god<br />
                evidently involves wine slurping<br />
          and fiendish laughter</p>
              <p>the reckless children scavage<br />
                on the back roads<br />
                in dumpsters<br />
                abandoned buildings<br />
                and the sun withers their skin<br />
          with a melting effect</p>
              <p>the island that cares for<br />
                the daft and the dark<br />
          drifted closer</p>
              <p>the nephilim<br />
                guard this constructed hellmouth<br />
                they are the revolting giants<br />
                of the damned<br />
                every soul here<br />
          carries disaster in their eyes</p>
              <p>trust doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
              <p>there are no books of guidance<br />
                no stone cut commandments</p>
              <p>everyone is equipped with<br />
                barbarian strength<br />
                and poet are looked at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                with disgust and hatred<br />
                they are a miscreation<br />
          and salt away in shame</p>
              <p><em>in perpetuum</em>.</p>
              <p>(from <em>Pistol Whipped</em>, 2008)</p>
