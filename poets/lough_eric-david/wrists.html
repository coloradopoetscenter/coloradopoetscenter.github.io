<h1>It wasn't my Intention to Slit my Wrists and Bleed all over your Evening</h1>
<p>She told me everything</p>
<p>her mutinous bruises blended  well with her outfit</p>
<p>the room of the old town hall  was filled with<br />tight lipped whiskey and woebegone  music</p>
<p>everyone sweated a mawkish ego<br />and carried yarn<br />  free for the taking</p>
<p>life stories were in flash  rewind</p>
<p>I politely turned my head<br />in a moment of failed  conversation<br />  scurried out the club door and  had a smoke</p>
<p>she straggled out<br />crippled<br />  flamboyant as a top</p>
<p>my thoughts wrangled with the  pavement</p>
<p>I shied down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; town<br />alone<br />with the yawps of desperation  slowly fading<br />  into the suicidal night</p>
<p>and not once<br />did I care to look back.</p>
<p>(from <em>Pistol Whipped</em>, 2008)</p>
