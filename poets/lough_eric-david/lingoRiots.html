<h1>Lingo Riots</h1>
<p>I can always feel them dousing  their hellish eyes on me<br />hurling massive stones on my  pale skin<br />kneading me with their birthmark  tones <br />fluttering from their lips<br />the kind of essence that kicks  you into a staggering drunk<br />tumbling <br />mumbling <br />for one more taste<br />one last sip<br />I carry the description of an  uncouth romantic <br />voluptuously damned<br />sunken like a Spanish goldmine  in need of some discovery <br />full of curiosity and  fantasizing praises<br />marvelous flowing carnivorous  river<br />they sift me in a frantic<br />they lavish me in frenzy<br />I see things that no one else  can see<br />I&rsquo;m a godly witness <br />drowning myself with some  rebellious philter<br />a chess piece in an infinite  game <br />of fantastic alignments of  disillusion<br />they play me with words <br />and free me of their stares<br />I beware the scowls of the  bayside lingo<br />red blooded movements<br />my music summons no beats<br />I am the only being that remains  constant<br />the undertone<br />the unbearable hum <br />that only the deaf can speak  about<br />I can taste tragedy in the wind<br />most raptorial friend <br />that heeds no warning<br />spearing the air <br />the way the attracting smell of  sex does<br />forcing me to taste one more <br />to sip at last<br />most adorable life <br />my spat of a sparrows flutter<br />let me touch the shrine<br />the ferocious glory<br />they kick me into an unbound  faithful harvester <br />and I&rsquo;m on that train again<br />open to the wind<br />feasting upon cupid&rsquo;s arrow <br />like an elegant wine <br />in search for blessed bread<br />fool for the dream day<br />am I ever gonna stay on my  trails <br />the ones I&rsquo;ve created with such  rambling thought<br />I dig the wander <br />the wonder <br />and they watch me<br />they know<br />they know how easy it is<br />how sly the mystery can be<br />their sinister smiles keep me  chained to their sides <br />poking me with their slimy lips <br />like a habit<br />racing to change my destiny <br />like electrified saliva on a  soul-natured tongue <br />and it&rsquo;s all quick to scatter <br />like crime in progress<br />I beg for wings in my hours of  death<br />remember my voice <br />my warming breath<br />dear love <br />sea of me<br />they spread like color in liquid<br />pure pleasure in my wicked  minute<br />today I ask <br />let me shed a few horrors <br />spare a few lives<br />let me howl into the junkyard  night<br />I want to be written in myth<br />eternal story<br />they know<br />my kind<br />taken from the true tongue<br />I just can&rsquo;t get enough <br />of going back over old roads <br />the way they creep <br />the way they smell in soft rain <br />and this night is good <br />  so good.</p>
