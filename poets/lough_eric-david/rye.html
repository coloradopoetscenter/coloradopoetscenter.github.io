<h1>Pandemonium on Rye</h1>
<p>Father in heaven<br />
king of kings<br />
I love the power of words<br />
the way they smell<br />
like sweat and morning breath <br />
in the sweltering heat<br />
the way they taste<br />
like luminous crystals <br />
exploding in the witching hour<br />
the way they feel<br />
like birth or death<br />
the way they want to feel<br />
like for one moment <br />
in your wondering existence<br />
you have a grasp of what it is <br />
to be an absolute being<br />
poetry and prose<br />
the true meaning of the soul<br />
a soul dog<br />
a lousy idol<br />
a monstrosity<br />
unleashing words for all  humanity<br />
with no understanding as to why<br />
the way they sound<br />
like coupes racing in the  stinging rain <br />
or leaves<br />
having a rotisserie of laughter  in the wind<br />
dinner<br />
dessert<br />
cognac among the fiasco<br />
a true bloodshed from the  pulpit.</p>
