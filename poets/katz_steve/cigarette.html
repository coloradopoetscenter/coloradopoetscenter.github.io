<h1>In Praise of the Cigarette</h1>
<p>Margaret covets my pressed plywood<br />
Rocking chair.&nbsp; If I sell or  if I die before<br />
She does she wants it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s  an attractive<br />
Chair missing some of its ornamentation,<br />
But not its overall charm.&nbsp;  She will sit<br />
In it on her verandah and rock and smoke<br />
A cigarette and smoke a cigarette and rock.<br />
She keeps track of the traffic on Sight<br />
Point Road&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t  believe<br />
The number of cars.&rdquo;&nbsp; Marg  is eighty-three<br />
And on the verge of having another<br />
Cigarette.&nbsp; When fresh out  of the womb<br />
Her father greeted her and said, &ldquo;Here<br />
Ya are, Margaret.&nbsp; Have a  smoke.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died<br />
Smoking, in his nineties, and she has never<br />
Not smoked.&nbsp; We bring her  cigarettes from<br />
The Duty-Free whenever we cross the border.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the cigarettes that causes all the cancer<br />
In Inverness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what they eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; What does<br />
Margaret eat?&nbsp; We ask  her.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I really enjoy,&rdquo;<br />
She tells us, &ldquo;Is a big plate of onion rings<br />
Smothered in gravy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s  good.&nbsp; An onion<br />
Is always a healthy thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;  She tells<br />
Of Bill, an old friend, a biodynamic farmer<br />
From Las Vegas,New Mexico, who owns<br />
The land once was her Alec&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp;  He suddenly<br />
Refuses to bring the cigarettes.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Was here<br />
The other day,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; A  look of disbelief,<br />
And scorn on her pretty face.&nbsp;  &ldquo;This time I saw<br />
Only a white bucket on my verandah.&nbsp; There<br />
Was something in it, red like tomatoes, a yellow<br />
One too, but they weren&rsquo;t tomatoes.&nbsp; I took the fuckin&rsquo;<br />
Things and threw them off into the bushes.&rdquo;<br />
Margaret derives her nutrition and good health<br />
From cigarettes embellished with onion rings<br />
And gravy.&nbsp; She will smoke a  cigarette<br />
And rock in my chair.&nbsp; She  will rock in my chair<br />
And smoke a cigarette and smoke another cigarette. </p>
