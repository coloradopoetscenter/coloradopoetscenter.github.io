<h1>The Donut World is Empty </h1>
<p>It's Denver October balmy across<br />
From the Queen Super, an outdoor<br />
Table at the bagelry in this city<br />
All miraculously bland.&nbsp; She<br />
Comes out with her dog on a leash<br />
To sit at the next table, a black<br />
Crepe micro-mini, no skivvies<br />
Under; head shaved, two tufts<br />
Of hair pale blue spouting from <br />
Skull above the ears.&nbsp; A three inch<br />
Studded bondage collar cuffs<br />
Her long neck, and wristlets too.<br />
She's been pierced generously <br />
In nose, lips, ears, and a chain <br />
From her navel ring runs under<br />
The skirt to someplace else.<br />
The message, <strong>&quot;IF YOU AIN&rsquo;T A WEST</strong><br />
<strong>MINSTER COP YOU AIN&rsquo;T SHIT&rdquo;</strong> <br />
arcs across her grey T-shirt.<br />
A few insect tattoos discretely set<br />
Peek out from waist and neckband.<br />
She is impeccable, and lovely, <br />
Her skin a cream of youth, her glance<br />
Aloof and innocent, maybe seventeen.<br />
She eats her bagel with meticulous<br />
Pleasure, reducing its outer <br />
Circumference nibble by nibble,<br />
Towards the center.&nbsp; The dog,<br />
An old one like me, whines<br />
As I would were I leashed <br />
To her chair, raises up and vocalizes<br />
His yearning.&nbsp; He wants his share<br />
Of the biscuit.&nbsp; Commerce <br />
At the super market is heavy,<br />
People escaping with carts down<br />
The streets to their apartments.<br />
My lady looks down at her old<br />
Pup and he whines.&nbsp; How he aches</p>
<p>To be herself.&nbsp; To him her tufts <br />Of hair have the pale blue sheen<br />Of diaphanous wings.&nbsp; He wants<br />So little, so much.&nbsp; She points<br />At him and firmly says, &quot;Fuck<br />You,&quot; and he backs down.<br />I'm watching this, my own bagel<br />  In my mouth, a retro buckaroo.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you,&quot; and his jowls  return,<br />Disposed to the indifferent<br />  Pavement of Denver, Colorado.&nbsp;</p>
