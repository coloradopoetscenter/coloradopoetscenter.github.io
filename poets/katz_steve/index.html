              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>Steve Katz was born in May of 1935, in the Bronx.  He has never not been a Yankee fan.&nbsp; Then  some kid with a stiletto stabbed his basketball in Washington Heights,  and that was <em>Creamy &amp; Delicious</em> (eat my words in other words), published in 1970 by Random House, that started  the avant-snack movement in the pre-postmodern revolution.&nbsp; But before that in 1968 he published at Holt,  Rinehart &amp; Winston, <em>The  Exagggerations of Peter Prince, </em>(three g&rsquo;s, we can explain it), the likes  of which novel has never been seen since, a Manhattan kind of a book,  provincial and puckered with graphics, full of skidmarks, false turns, pictures  of boats and midwifing instruments, a paragraph written by the pre-eminent  Peter Schjeldahl, a whole section crossed out, another overprinted with  dreams.&nbsp; Even before that, he published <em>The Lestriad</em> in Lecce, Italy,  a novella of immense innovation, recently reprinted by Bamberger Books.&nbsp; Meanwhile he was living his life, three great  kids and a great wife.&nbsp; He lived it in  Eugene, Oregon, in Winnemucca, Nevada, in Lecce, Italy, and in Verona, Italy,  in Ithaca, New York, in New York City; and he worked for the forest service,  and in a mercury mine, and as many different kinds of waiters, and construction  work, and bartender and other things, and then he started teaching, which was  subversive, because school always made him uncomfortable, and he had never been  good at student life.&nbsp; He lives now in Denver, Colorado, retired  from teaching at the University   of Colorado.&nbsp; And he has studied Chinese internal martial  arts, and he still does, so he knows how to hurt himself.&nbsp; And he published <em>Saw</em> at Alfred Knopf, a sci-fi swat team of a novel that  demonstrates how a hippopotamus evades an astronaut, safe sex with a sphere,  and how oblivion comes when a cylinder's on the loose.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as a Fiction Collective pioneer he  published <em>Moving Parts</em>, a book that  among other things, zeroed in on the number 43, and was the first work of  retrojournalism, in which the author writes an enormous, fantastic story,  called <em>Parcel of Wrists</em> and then  keeps a journal as he sets out to live that fiction.&nbsp; Then he took a small bite out of the ass of Hollywood, writing with Leo Garen a film called Grassland,  later rented out as Hex, now rented as The Shrieking, though the best that came  of it for himself was <em>Cheyenne River Wild  Track, </em>&nbsp;a book of poems focused on  making a feature film in exotic South    Dakota.&nbsp; Very  quickly the new and improved <em>Stolen  Stories</em> came out at the Fiction Collective, a book of yarns classic as  godzillo riding a hunch from noter dame, such stories of spiritual dread and  mortal triumph as never before squeezed into a tube of instant language  paste.&nbsp; (Available from the author in  convenient family size for sexual avoidance or indulgence, as you wish.&nbsp; 43 bucks.)&nbsp;  Sun &amp; Moon Press, bless its enthusiastic, evasive, courageous little  publishing heart, produced an unparalleled threesome of books &ndash; <em>Wier &amp; Pouce, Florry of Washington Heights, Swanny&rsquo;s Ways. </em>This triad,  is a brand new investigation of the art of narrative, and an heroic assessment  of our times.&nbsp; Then <em>Journalism, </em>&nbsp;a book of poems  -- <em>prison, New York City, Hollywood, Cape  Breton</em> -- so compassioned, so germane.&nbsp;  And Sun &amp; Moon did <em>43 Fiction, </em>&nbsp;swiping passages from all his books,  and including some new works of mind expanding, free-fall honesty and free  speech.&nbsp; His novel, Antonello&rsquo;s Lion,  came out this Fall from Green Integer, to be followed at some time soon by <em>Kissssss, </em>a miscellany of short pieces,  from FC2.&nbsp; A book length monograph about  his work called <em>43 Views of Steve Katz,</em> by William Bamberger, Phd, is forthcoming soon from Borgo Press.</p>
              <p> Yesterday Steve Katz gave up writing  to volunteer for a program that puts him in feathers, transforms him from a  human being (of which there is an enormous glut), into a California condor (of  which there be pitiful few).&nbsp; So if you  feel the shadow pass over your body as you stroll in Santa Monica or Borrego  Springs, in Woodstock or Halifax, and happen to look up to find its silent  source, it could be steve katz that hits you in the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
