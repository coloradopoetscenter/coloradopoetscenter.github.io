              <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
              
              <p>SAW is a milestone novel of the seventies.&nbsp; It is the first work of fiction ever to hide  a hippopotamus.&nbsp; For the first time what  has come to be recognized as a common modern neurosis, astronaut angst, gets  full play in the fictional universe.&nbsp; For  the first time anywhere in the history of fiction, in one of the most  passionate encounters ever written, Eileen mates with a Sphere.&nbsp; Solid geometry finally has a face.&nbsp; The Cylinder is a nemesis, and its terrifying  accomplishments roll on like a nightmare for this astronaut.&nbsp; This is a work of science fiction, geometric  fiction, irrefutable fact, and gourmand fantasies.</p>
              <p>Steve Katz, whose SWANNY'S WAYS won the America Award in fiction  in 1995 was acclaimed for SAW by the New York Times Book Review as &quot;... a  witty fantasist who can homogenize pop detritus, campy slang and hallucination  to achieve inspired chaos.&quot;</p>
              
              <p>Steve Katz  comes off the loping forward rush of his latest masterful novel, &ldquo;Antonello&rsquo;s  Lion,&rdquo; with a collection of short pieces: acerbic, innovative, humorous. and  above all, perversely engaging.<br />
                --Rudy Wurlitzer, author of <em>Nog, Flats, Quake, Slow Fade, Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid,</em> etc.</p>
              <p>Steve  Katz&rsquo;s comic genius is subversive. Readers beware. You may die laughing.<br />
                --Walter Abish, author of <em>How German Is it, Alphabetical Africa,  Eclipse Fever, </em>etc.,</p>
              <p>Steve Katz  is an American treasure: a delirious imagination in a major stylist. His 21006  novel, <em>Antonello&rsquo;s Lion</em>, is an epic  comic lament. Reading these stories you can imagine Flann O&rsquo;Brien crossed with  Nathaniel West. No one has chronicled the impact of the women&rsquo;s movement more  vividly and withy less bias. No one has performed more loving surgery on the  international art scene.<br />
              --Wendy  Walker, author of <em>The Seat Rabbit,  Stories Out of Omarie.</em></p>
              <p>In my opinion, Steve Katz is the greatest living novelist in  English,<br />
                and the one most likely to keep our hearts and minds in  good-working<br />
                order, to keep us truly human in a world where brainless  tech-loving<br />
                Moorlocks hog the sunshine, and thoughtful, life loving Eloi have  been<br />
          driven underground.</p>

              <p>&quot;Katz is the closest to being a jazz musician with language,  using his gift for sound and circumstance to create dazzling  improvisations.&quot;<br />
  -Jerome  Klinkowitz in <em>The Life Of Fiction</em></p>
              <p>&quot;Like Rimbaud, Steve Katz was formed of ice and polar nights,  and as always he is much alive, hurt and hurting, loved and loving, a  contentious knight of Hope out to do battle with the toothless electronic  Dragon of Commerce.&quot;<br />
  - Michael  Stephens on <em>Moving Parts</em> in <em>American Book Review</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p>&quot;What Katz has done is open up another dimension of  communication within the closed idea of what constitutes the novel.&nbsp; The book...shakes off the past like a heavy,  dull stone...and gives hope to fiction...&quot;<br />
                - Seymour Krim on <em>The Exaggerations of Peter Prince</em><br />
                <br />
&quot;One anticipates that with the publication of his recent  masterwork, Swanny's Ways, critically acclaimed yet largely overlooked writer  Steve Katz will receive the serious attention he deserves.<br />
- Murray Shugars in <em>The Sycamore Review</em></p>
              <p>&quot;Almost perfect in originality and purpose, The  Exagggerations Of Peter Prince may be one of the most creative novels to be  published in English since the twenties...&nbsp;  It is brilliant with flawless beauty.&quot;<br />

              <p>&quot;According to me, the most important living American  novelist...<br />
