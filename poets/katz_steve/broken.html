              <h1>Broken Koan</h1>
              <p>Leonard Cohen is broke<br />
Ripped off by his manager<br />
He says however he has hope<br />
His new songs will restore<br />
His wealth&nbsp;&nbsp; let us all  meditate<br />
On Leonard Cohen who has given<br />
Great song&nbsp;&nbsp; may he once  again<br />
Lean as any Buddha can into<br />
The cushion of good money </p>
