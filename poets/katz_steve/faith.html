<h1>Faith</h1>
<p>Castrate Pat Robertson<br />Pierce his tongue with a burning cross<br />Lift Enola Gay out of mothballs<br />To carry his balls over Venezuela<br />When dropped they will explode<br />With the thud of a raisin smacking<br />A dish of oatmeal.&nbsp;  Evangelical fun-<br />  Damentalist son of a bitch -- excommunicate</p>
<p>His ass across the universe</p>
