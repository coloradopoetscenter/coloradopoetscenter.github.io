              <p> </p>
              <p>I might have said I love you</p>
              <p>ten thousand echoes reside</p>
              <p>Three wandering Moons of Atlantis</p>
              <p>conspire to conceal, they hide</p>
              <p>the city; my love is a rainbow</p>
              <p>whose path is come open and wide</p>
              <p>a tumble me down and forever</p>
              <p>whistling of prayer, neap tide</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I might have said who are you</p>
              <p>whose sleep I have come to share</p>
              <p>far misty mountains abiding</p>
              <p>a halo of Sun as they bear</p>
              <p>tree Children; my love is a whis&rsquo;pring</p>
              <p>wind through the needles, their hair</p>
              <p>Lift me up, I&rsquo;m a flying man</p>
              <p>whose heart is lighter than air</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I might have said where are you</p>
              <p>lonely nights lying awake</p>
              <p>a misty gath&rsquo;ring of shadow</p>
              <p>fair ghosts of tomorrow may shake</p>
              <p>their heads, my love is a phantom</p>
              <p>a cry of hope for their sake</p>
              <p>whose spirit may lie in my bosom</p>
              <p>a lay me down I would make</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I might have said I&rsquo;ve found you</p>
              <p>into the face of the night</p>
              <p>The Sun, a cascade of falling</p>
              <p>makes narrowing pathways of light</p>
              <p>A fire, my love is a ribbon</p>
              <p>shimmering gem of delight</p>
              <p>the body of faith come rewarded</p>
              <p>healing caresses ignite</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I might have said I love you</p>
              <p>then finally found your face</p>
              <p>the stars, a sprinkling of Heaven</p>
              <p>find sorrow and come to erase</p>
              <p>the dark, my love is a promise</p>
              <p>a choosing of time and place</p>
              <p>whose moment I have come seeking</p>
              <p>has found me and blessed me with grace</p>
