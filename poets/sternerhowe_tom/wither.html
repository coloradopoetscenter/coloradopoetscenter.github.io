              <h1>Wither Go Watching </h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the final dance is over</p>
              <p>I'll be holding up the wall</p>
              <p>with these eyes a thousand candles</p>
              <p>years passing down the hall</p>
              <p>I see you in your soft gown</p>
              <p>wings of eternal lace</p>
              <p>in a pirouette never-ending</p>
              <p>your fall through the fingers of grace</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the last grave has been filled</p>
              <p>I will stand me aside with my spade</p>
              <p>bite down through layers of dust</p>
              <p>lost civilizations have made</p>
              <p>I will kiss your skin through a candle</p>
              <p>ashes and blood of your name</p>
              <p>with lips of ten thousand lovers</p>
              <p>Godforsaken and soon to be slain</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When the tide is a weeping of rivers</p>
              <p>flames a face on the sand</p>
              <p>I will shed my garment reveal</p>
              <p>at last and for once who I am</p>
              <p>Children awake in the forest</p>
              <p>wander a garden of Moon</p>
              <p>Sleep as Earth is your cradle</p>
              <p>held in a moment of lune</p>
              <p></p>
