<h1>Looking up at the Sky</h1><p>  My friend, this solstice moon reminds me to look up at the sky —<br />  The brightest moon in a hundred years, they say, but right now I<br />  Can't make out the features I like best for all this blinding light:<br />  The features my father taught to me on moonless winter nights,<br />  When we would walk up to Clifton Park (where summers I played ball)<br />  And peer at the deep of space to find the Dippers large and small,<br />  The twins, the bull, Orion's Belt, but most of all the Queen's Chair,<br />  My favorite because harder to find and closer to my scale<br />  And the scale of my father's love. My eye seeks it even still<br />  Among the million numberless stars — the stars that I feel will,<br />  Fighting distance, connect me to you, to my passed father's life,<br />  To the numberless millions who lived on earth before my time,<br />  To the numberless more who'll live here once I'm gone — or who may,<br />  For all I know, not live here at all but venture out away<br />  Into space, expand the home of man. For them the stars will be<br />  Their park (will they play with comets as I played ball?) — yet I see<br />  In my mind's eye that sometimes they'll look back at where the earth mustlie<br />  And feel as I do when, thinking of you, I look up at the sky.<br /></p><em>Ancient Fire</em> (Monadnock Valley Press, 2013).<br /><br />
