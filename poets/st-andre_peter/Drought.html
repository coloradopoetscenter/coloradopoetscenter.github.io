<h1>Drought</h1><p>  Acorn-pummeled, the house withstands<br />  The onslaught of overhanging oaks,<br />  Whose outstretched arms had once stood guard,<br />  Whose dried-up fruit lies deep now on the yard.<br /><br />  Likewise, the verdure of the lawn<br />  (Green carpet rolled out to greet the world)<br />  Has turned to tawny brown and bare<br />  Except where crabgrass clings, like tufts of hair.<br /><br />  Though droopy plants are nodding off<br />  And the parched earth cries for dew and rain,<br />  The oaks stand strong (their roots run deep)<br />  And life is merely lying low, asleep.<br /></p><em>Ancient Fire</em> (Monadnock Valley Press, 2013).
