              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>Peter Saint-Andre was trained in philosophy and classics at Columbia University, but decided against an academic career and instead has worked as a technologist since the mid-1990s. Although his primary intellectual interests are in philosophy, he has published one collection of poems and translations (<a href='http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Fire-Translations-Peter-Saint-Andre/dp/0615848966/'>Ancient Fire</a>, Monadnock Valley Press, 2013) and is currently working on a cycle of poems about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche./p>
