        <h1>On a Visit to the Musée Rodin</h1>
        <p>
          Although I know no French, the usher's glare is universal:<br />
  &quot;Look but do not touch.&quot; Yet can one know the passion of the kiss<br />
          Just by looking? The eyes are not enough; and neither are the hands.<br />
  <br />
          I require no reminder, yet here it is: in comes a girl,<br />
          Stark blind, her family leading her from room to room as I watch —<br />
          Roiled by envy, wakened by pity, held by fascination.<br />
  <br />
          Her gentle warm hands move slowly over the cold unmoving<br />
          Marble, changed brusquely by its maker from unfeeling stone to<br />
          These violent images of longing, love, and living passion.<br />
  <br />
          In her darkness she holds a way of knowing that's not allowed<br />
          To me. I sneak a touch while the usher is turned but it is as<br />
          Nothing to her loving caress. Once again, authorities<br />
  <br />
          Enforce the dualism of eye and hand. Why can we not join<br />
          The understanding of sight and touch? It's what we need so we can feel<br />
          As much as we would feel, and live in light that does not end at stone.<br />
