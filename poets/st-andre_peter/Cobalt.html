        <p>
          My friend is a cobalt poetry goddess:<br />
          She turns her phrases with a quiet power<br />
          And dances among her words with style and grace,<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;Like Sappho herself.<br />
  <br />
          But she's often, so often, blue: the color<br />
          Of the twilight sky, deep and clear, bordering<br />
          On the blackest night, yet never losing hold<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the light of day.<br />
  <br />
          Sometimes I wish I could brighten her a shade<br />
          Or two — make her azure or cerulean.<br />
          But then I know I'd never want to change her<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;Blue poetic soul.<br />
