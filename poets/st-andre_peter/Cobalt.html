<h1>Cobalt</h1><p>  My friend is a cobalt poetry goddess:<br />  She turns her phrases with a quiet power<br />  And dances among her words with style and grace,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Like Sappho herself.<br /><br />  But she's often, so often, blue: the color<br />  Of the twilight sky, deep and clear, bordering<br />  On the blackest night, yet never losing hold<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Of the light of day.<br /><br />  Sometimes I wish I could brighten her a shade<br />  Or two — make her azure or cerulean.<br />  But then I know I'd never want to change her<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Blue poetic soul.<br /></p><em>Ancient Fire</em> (Monadnock Valley Press, 2013).<br />
