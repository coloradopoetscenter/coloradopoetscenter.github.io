<h1>Mid-Air</h1><p><em>Sermon Series, Finishing Line Press,  September 2017</em></p><p>I  exist in mid-air.</p><p>I  will hit the earth <br />  like  a rock hard clump of dust<br />  and  leave a crater in my wake.</p><p>I  will hit the dirt <br />  as  though it were a drum <br />  and  I&rsquo;m a purposeful rhythm</p><p>beating. </p>
