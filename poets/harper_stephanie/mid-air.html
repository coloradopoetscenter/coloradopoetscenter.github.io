        <h1>Mid-Air</h1>
        <p><em>Sermon Series, Finishing Line Press,  September 2017</em></p>
        <p>I  exist in mid-air.</p>
        <p>I  will hit the earth <br />
          like  a rock hard clump of dust<br />
          and  leave a crater in my wake.</p>
        <p>I  will hit the dirt <br />
          as  though it were a drum <br />
          and  I&rsquo;m a purposeful rhythm</p>
        <p>beating. </p>
