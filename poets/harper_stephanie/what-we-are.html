<h1>What We Are</h1><p><em>Sermon Series, Finishing Line Press,  September 2017</em></p><p>We  are all water.<br />  We  are cells and skin and vapor. <br />  We  are the earth, the sky,<br />  the  heat at the center, <br />  and  the cold in faraway reaches, <br />  the  ones that lie in darkness. <br />  We  are made of stars.</p>
