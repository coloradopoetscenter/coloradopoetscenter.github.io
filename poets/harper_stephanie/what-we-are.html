        <h1>What We Are</h1>
        <p><em>Sermon Series, Finishing Line Press,  September 2017</em></p>
        <p>We  are all water.<br />
          We  are cells and skin and vapor. <br />
          We  are the earth, the sky,<br />
          the  heat at the center, <br />
          and  the cold in faraway reaches, <br />
          the  ones that lie in darkness. <br />
          We  are made of stars.</p>
