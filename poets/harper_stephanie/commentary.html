        <p>Stephanie Harper's  Sermon Series offers a respite from the fast-paced cacophony of our world:  brief, meditative poems of searching, fully open to delight. &nbsp;This is a  pilgrimage of details mined from the natural world, and the private landscape  of the speaker's soul. &nbsp;Harper offers that oft-forgotten but vital ingredient of  prayer and the sacred experience: listening born of silence. &nbsp;A sermon, like the best sacred poetry, is a vehicle  of preaching. &nbsp;In the words of priest and poet, Thomas Merton,  &quot;Preaching God implies silence. If preaching is not born of silence, it is  a waste of time.&quot; &nbsp;In Sermon Series, one can feel the poet listening  between her words, as in the collection's final poem: &quot;with quiet purpose,  the way a steady stream (glides) over smoothly faceted stone.&quot; This is  perhaps the best gift of the collection: it makes the reader listen, too.&nbsp;        </p>
