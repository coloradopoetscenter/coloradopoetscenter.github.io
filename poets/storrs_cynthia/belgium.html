  <h1 >To  Belgium</h1>  <p > Narrow streets of cobblestone <br /> hem in slender brick red houses <br /> presenting inscrutable door handles<br /> useless without a key.<br /> Sundays, shuttered to the world<br /> villages seem deserted<br /> dreaming, empty, waiting for<br /> their flocks of Monday children to return at four  o’clock,<br /> weighted with book bags,<br /> swooping into doorways for their afternoon tartines.</p>  <p>Discreet figures finger lace curtains.<br /> They dip and peer and disappear<br /> like shadows under water.</p>  <p>Belgium, cacophony of tongues,<br /> French and Flemish, German and English,<br /> bilingual street signs, too small to be read by any  fleeting car.</p>  <p>Dialects dying, soon to be forgotten like Walloon  steel,<br /> rusting in the fields<br /> where orange poppies bloom.</p>  <p>Belgium gourmand, <br /> “A different beer for every day of the year,”<br /> of moules  et frites<br /> (with mayonnaise, if you please.)<br /> of craquelin  and cramique-- <br /> tender breads whose crusts crunch like their names  upon your tongue.<br /> And chocolate!  <br /> Libation of the gods,<br /> poured upon the altar of food at which the Belgians  worship.</p>  <p>Baroque Belgium, sparkling like an Antwerp diamond, <br /> steady as the dark rivers, the Meuse and Sambre,<br /> bloody as the ruined farms at Waterloo, Ypres, Bastogne.</p>  <p>Canals wind past crumbling chateaux, the waters making moats,<br /> reflecting pools under leaden skies.<br /> Long, low banks of purple clouds, heavy with  moisture<br /> bump and crowd one another for position.<br /> sullen, they scuttle away at dusk,<br /> leaving streaks of peach and pink, turquoise and  mauve<br /> revealing the sun that was there all the time.  <br />  </p>  <p>Tenacious Belgium,<br /> intriguing as your dialects<br /> comical as your Smurfs,<br /> pompous as your Eurocrats--</p>  <p>While I stood, unawares, eyes agape-- <br /> at your dark, feudal dungeons,<br /> at your cathedrals of stone lace,<br /> at your gold sheeted Guild houses,<br /> at your swirling Art Nouveau--<br /> my tongue smoothed by chocolate, <br /> my hands filled with bread,<br /> unknowing and helpless to resist, </p>  <p>you filched my heart like a pickpocket does a  tourist <br /> in the Grand’ Place. </p>  <p>(Published on LanguageandCulture.net)</p>
