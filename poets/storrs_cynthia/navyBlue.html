  <h1 >Navy  Blue</h1>  <p > The  photo shows you at attention,<br /> in heavy woolen 13-button pants,<br /> the middy shirt with satin ribbon.  <br /> It smelled <br /> of moth balls when I got it.<br /> Dark, deep Navy blue,<br /> the uniform you discarded, treasured by your mother<br /> I wore on Halloween.<br /> I was thirteen.</p>  <p>Navy blue, dense wool, impervious to rain,<br /> it kept you warm from the foggy Golden Gate <br /> crossing the dateline to the Battle of the  Philippines.</p>  <p>I wore the dark and somber coat<br /> holding candles in the rain<br /> marching all night to recall<br /> classmates slain at Kent State.<br /> I was the only one who kept warm that night.<br /> <br /> Wrapped in that sailor suit—<br /> that navy blue <br /> made me a soldier, too.<br /> I was proud of my uniform (and yours)<br /> but my “Ban the Bomb” embroidery<br /> made you frown.  <br /> We fought<br /> different wars, at different times.</p>  <p>Navy blue, flat cap perched upon my son’s lamp.<br /> The pride piece in his collection of hats<br /> is all that’s left of the block of blue<br /> that colored the photo and your young life,<br /> the uniform that lifted you from factory to school.<br /> You finished college in a navy suit, and found a  wife.<br /> A grandson with your ears now wears that cap.</p>  <p>And as for me—<br /> my Bible, briefcase, umbrella, purse<br /> my coat, five pairs of pants and shoes, sweaters I  choose<br /> all are navy, navy blue.<br /> Dad --<br /> for  you.<br /> <br /> (To appear in an anthology of patriotic works,  Spring 2012.  Used with permission. )</p>
