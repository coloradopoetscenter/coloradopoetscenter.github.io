  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>“Thank you so much for coming to read and share  with sixth grade.  Poetry seems very  distant and difficult to many of them, but you made it come alive!”  <br />--  Bethany Kjergaard, teacher</p>  <p>“It was a privilege to have Cynthia Storrs as a  speaker for the NCTE’s National Day on Writing . . . Mrs. Storrs captivated the  audience [with her work] and introduced them to the writers that already exist  within themselves.”<br /> --Augusta  Lucas, Literacy Resource</p>  <p>“The kids loved her presentation and said the class  was just too short—they wanted to hear more!”<br /> --Bridget  Kingsford, teacher</p>
