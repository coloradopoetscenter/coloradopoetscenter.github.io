  <h1>Opening Night</h1>  <p> (for  my son, written while I was in Europe)</p>  <p>A thousand eyes<br /> watched you turn beneath the lights.<br /> In my mind's eye I see your shoulders roll and  twist,<br /> your eyes quiz and mist.  Your chin tightens.<br /> I can hear them laugh,<br /> their open mouths in O's<br /> lips dark under dimmed house lights.<br /> <br /> You can see vague outlines <br /> in the orchestra seats.<br /> Did you look for me <br /> in the first row?Did someone else <br /> wait outside the wings with <br /> flowers for you, this opening night?</p>  <p>On the other side of night<br /> it's early morning.I cannot sleep.<br /> I sit and marvel at this wonder-<br /> you animate  the stage, you create <br /> and recreate a life<br /> without me watching.</p>  <p>I, who watched your every act<br /> from birth to walking,<br /> now boy become a man.</p>  <p>You play another scene, a different crowd.</p>  <p>Through the silence of six thousand miles <br /> I hear the applause.<br /> I would shout--&quot;That's my son!&quot; <br /> But I am dumb in the stillness.</p>  <p>Without a sound, I weep, smiling.</p>  <p>(Published in <em>Mom  Writer’s Literary Journal</em>, Summer, 2007)</p>
