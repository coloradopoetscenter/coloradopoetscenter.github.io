<h1>About The Spider  Poem<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That This Is Not&nbsp;&nbsp; </h1>
<p>Perhaps you're  lucky I haven't written it.<br />They were too  stout, those threads,<br />eleven thousand  feet high<br />braving the wind  through the pass<br />and the spiders  - I can't tell you<br />  about those  spiders yet.&nbsp; They keep</p>
<p>spinning in my  mind, new webbing,<br />enveloping  themselves in layer after layer<br />of fur that  shifts to the view<br />like a  compounding of myths.<br />They're not  prepared to be<br />exposed.&nbsp; They're waiting behind<br />eyes I can't  quite look into<br />to pass through  a winter only they<br />and a barren,  rock-eyed mountain top<br />  know so  far.&nbsp; I can't touch them yet.</p>
<p>When I finally  spin the tale of spiders<br />it will be  something new,<br />but such ancient  threads I'll use,<br />such old, old  secrets of weaving<br />to mesmerize  both watcher and weaver<br />that neither  will ever again<br />  fly free.&nbsp; Wait and see.</p>
