<h1>Growing Old in Cold Country</h1>
<p><em>--for my mother </em></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>It is less difficult than she thought</p>

<p>in small changes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a few dark hairs</p>
<p>turning gray&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a few more</p>
<p>slowly changing to white&nbsp;&nbsp; the eyes</p>
<p>narrowing at the corners</p>
<p>the nose too</p>
<p>thinner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sharper</p>
<p>quick to catch scent</p>
<p>of shifts in the weather</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Soon she will be </p>
<p>the white fox running</p>
<p>across vast expanses of white</p>
<p>No one will see her</p>
<p>No one will guess she has gone or suspect</p>
<p>she has carried away the breath of their world</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When they sense their loss</p>
<p>there will be no trace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her footprints</p>
<p>white on white drifted in</p>
<p>with white&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will go blind</p>
<p>searching &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and what wind they have left</p>
<p>for the chase will be sucked from them</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>weak jet streams on the tail of her scent</p>
<p>slowly dissolving</p>
<p>in thin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
