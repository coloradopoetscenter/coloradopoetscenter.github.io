<h1>Just Seeing</h1>
<p> I&rsquo;m just sitting here </p>
<p> reading some poetry </p>
<p> it doesn&rsquo;t matter whose </p>
<p> and I look out </p>
<p> the north window </p>
<p> not to see really </p>
<p> but to contemplate some lines </p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve just read </p>
<p> and this deer <span class="space">a doe</span> </p>
<p> is suddenly there </p>
<p> on the slope near the house </p>
<p> quietly munching </p>
<p> the dry late November grass </p>
<p> washed by rays of low sun </p>
<p> deep tan with highlights </p>
<p> of buff and gold </p>
<p> the same color as the deer <span class="space">yes</span> </p>
<p> moving now through the grass </p>
<p> like a soft wind </p>
<p> becoming grass and then </p>
<p> deer again </p>
<p> and I&rsquo;m struck </p>
<p> with the thought <span class="space">hard</span> </p>
<p> like with a rock nudged </p>
<p> off the hill there <span class="space">Why</span> </p>
<p> me <span class="space">how can I be so blessed</span> </p>
<p> to see this </p>
<p> just sitting here with no effort </p>
<p> and I sit still </p>
<p> no longer contemplating </p>
<p> anything </p>
<p> but just seeing and seeing </p>
<p> really seeing </p>
<p> deer </p>
