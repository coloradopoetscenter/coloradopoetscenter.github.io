  <h1>The Monarchs </h1>
<p> When the butterflies lifted </p>
<p> in fall, a sudden audible fluttering </p>
<p> of hundreds of wings </p>
<p> from the circle of pines </p>
<p> that will remain </p>
<p> forever magic </p>
<p> for their resting there </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> they were not for pinning down </p>
<p> like chloroformed specimens </p>
<p> to the poem </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> were not for catching </p>
<p> in any net </p>
<p> but the holy eye </p>
<p> of the mind, migrating </p>
<p> out of our heads </p>
<p> on the wind of our breath </p>
<p> of oh and ah </p>
<p> into a country </p>
<p> where words would wander </p>
<p> helpless as bats </p>
<p> in stark sunlight </p>
<p> were they to try </p>
<p> to follow. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> It is because of them, </p>
<p> butterflies fed since birth </p>
<p> on namesake </p>
<p> of the God of medicine, </p>
<p> the healing milkweed, </p>
<p> because of those Monarchs at dusk </p>
<p> I know now </p>
<p> I will never write </p>
<p> the real butterfly poem </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> nor will you write it </p>
<p> though,&nbsp;believe&nbsp;me, </p>
<p> I wished it for you </p>
<p> or just for the sake </p>
<p> of the hungry, bony </p>
<p> Word </p>
<p> but it will not be </p>
<p> fleshed out in this way. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> We cannot release </p>
<p> what cannot be contained </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> the poem </p>
<p> that refuses the rule </p>
<p> of words, </p>
<p> flushed only </p>
<p> for an incredible moment </p>
<p> from its secret resting place </p>
<p> before migrating back </p>
<p> to that wild country </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> where nothing can pursue it </p>
<p> save by facing the perils </p>
<p> of passing through, </p>
<p> a risk of becoming </p>
<p> Poem </p>
<p> to touch it </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> where words, like ourselves </p>
<p> are stopped </p>
<p> at the primitive boundaries </p>
<p> silent </p>
<p> and full of light </p>  <p> from its passing. </p>
