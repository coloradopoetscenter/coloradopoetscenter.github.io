  <h1>Strategies for Survival</h1>
<p>Our fossilized bones</p>
<p>someday may lie</p>
<p>slipped scarcely beneath</p>
<p>the dark upper loam</p>
<p>of earth, &quot;finds&quot;</p>
<p>for the children</p>
<p>with gilt hair</p>
<p>and body suits of gold mail</p>
<p>or some fine fabric made</p>
<p>possible by the discovery</p>
<p>of that one fail-safe element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Old body</p>
<p>be determined</p>
<p>to leave nothing but dust</p>
<p>for these sun-charmed children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bones are nothing</p>
<p>but messages</p>
<p>saying repeat me, love me</p>
<p>back into shape</p>
<p>that I was, clacking</p>
<p>their fleshless way</p>
<p>into the hearts</p>
<p>of children born forgetting</p>
<p>they have them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crumble, bones, scatter</p>
<p>gnash yourselves to nothing</p>
<p>like teeth of fitful sleepers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>do not claim what you were</p>
<p>nor offer yourselves up</p>
<p>for inspection</p>
<p>rejection</p>
<p>collection</p>
<p>and especially not for</p>
<p>loving reconstruction.</p>
<p>The world has had enough</p>
<p>of love--it often breeds </p>
<p>and feeds such moral</p>
<p>hates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better, we say, to leave</p>
<p>these wandering children</p>
<p>wandering</p>
<p>than to trip them up</p>
<p>with absurd old relics of a kind</p>
<p>that destroyed itself</p>
<p>for love</p>
<p>of too much</p>
<p>or perhaps</p>
<p>of too little</p>
<p>in too great amounts but nevertheless</p>
<p>for love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better, we say (in the dark, and only</p>
<p>when our own children sleep)</p>
<p>to leave no trace</p>
<p>that might entice</p>
<p>that one slightly curious</p>
<p>star-eyed drifter</p>
<p>(too like these vulnerable ones</p>
<p>we've known) away from aimless</p>
<p>care-less drifting...better,</p>
<p>we whisper...and dream</p>
<p>separately</p>
<p>secretly</p>
<p>of arrows on rocks, scripts in caves,</p>
<p>bulges in earth just strange enough</p>
<p>to tempt a digger, leave clues</p>
<p>all through the restless night</p>
<p>until children, bright-faced</p>
<p>and gilt-haired in sunlight</p>
<p>wake these late sleepers</p>
<p>to morning.</p>
