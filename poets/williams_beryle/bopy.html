<h1>The Boy Next Door </h1>
<p><em>for J. J. </em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  <p> He brings me letters</p>
<p>with words so strange</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they must be written</p>
<p>in some ancient script,</p>
<p>flowers before</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve begun to bloom,</p>
<p>feathers from birds</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p> Much is mystery</p>
<p>to him</p>
<p>and to me when he&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p> Today he is</p>
<p>flapping around on my porch</p>
<p>bumping the walls</p>
<p>with something.</p>
<p>Finally he reaches</p>
<p>my door, knocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p> &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he says, his face</p>
<p>more sober than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today I&rsquo;m being a bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two stick-hung U.S.</p>
<p>flags have become</p>
<p>his wings, another</p>
<p>nondescript plastic one</p>
<p>his tail. &ldquo;I can tell,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reply, &ldquo;I never thought</p>
<p>of using flags like that.</p>
<p>Do they work pretty well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p> His wings have become</p>
<p>crossed.&nbsp; Working hard,</p>
<p>he is finally rearranged</p>
<p>and gasps &ldquo;Yes, they do.</p>
<p>Do you....&rdquo; (now his tail</p>
<p>has slipped and he twists</p>
<p>to get it back in</p>
<p>the proper place.) &ldquo;Do you...&rdquo;</p>
<p>he begins again,</p>
<p>&ldquo;ever want to be a bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>  <p> &ldquo;Oh, often,&rdquo; I reply,</p>
<p>&ldquo;but first I have to learn</p>
<p>how to fly!&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t even read</p>
<p>his look but without</p>
<p>another word except for</p>
<p>one last swipe of a drooping</p>
<p>tail on my dusty porch</p>
<p>he flies off, leaving me</p>
<p>stranded.</p>
<p>No flags.</p>
