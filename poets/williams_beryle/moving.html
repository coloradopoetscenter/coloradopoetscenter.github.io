              <h1>Moving Toward  Winter</h1>
              <p>this is the cold  we need<br />
                this frozen  chunk of dark<br />
                we suck on with  delight<br />
                we felt as kids  with our mom's<br />
          pop-flavored  ice-cubes</p>
              <p>this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with stars so sharp<br />
                they pierce the  night black<br />
                pupils of our  eyes<br />
                with an  almost-pain<br />
                that with  masochistic pleasure<br />
          we demand again  and again</p>
              <p>some grown so  large<br />
                in this clear  air<br />
                that even to our  naked eyes<br />
                they reveal  themselves<br />
                unlike their  city pose<br />
                as  pinpoints&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but with form<br />
          misshapen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; circled by moons or</p>
              <p>planes of  light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we want<br />
                to name  them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claim them<br />
                yet let them  stay wild<br />
                like the  whippoorwill we named<br />
                Old Red-Eye  because light beams<br />
                do that to him  at night<br />
                every night he  sings on<br />
                the broken  branch of the oak<br />
          near the old  hewn-log house</p>
              <p>and later out by  the graves<br />
                of the  children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they say<br />
                he has sung here<br />
                for a hundred  years of summer<br />
                dusks and  pre-dawn hours<br />
                but fall sends  him off somewhere<br />
                or in  somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who knows<br />
                and last time we  were here<br />
                his voice had  grown sad<br />
                it could be a  she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak <br />
                and croaky as if  with a cold<br />
                and tonight  there is no singing<br />
   winter  being imminent<br />
                perhaps already  here&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still<br />
                what sphere  sounds there are<br />
                on these black  crystal nights<br />
                will suffice  until that bird<br />
                returns as we  know it will<br />
          drawing  closer&nbsp;&nbsp; growing wilder</p>
              <p>on night walks  passers-by eye us<br />
                warily&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move further over<br />
                in their  lane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something<br />
                has got into  us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or out of us<br />
                since we have  come to this place<br />
                perhaps it is  madness<br />
                perhaps we  fantasized <br />
                these three  small graves at the edge<br />
                of the  woods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreamed<br />
                the three small  pines<br />
                that grow now on  top<br />
                all twisted  together like<br />
                gnarled green  gnomes or<br />
                children in  abandoned play<br />
                that were not  here until after<br />
                we came with  love&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; searching <br />
                for ways life  renews it<br />
          for signs that  it lasts</p>
              <p>perhaps we grew  them<br />
                with  wanting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these children<br />
                these trees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this place<br />
                to keep patterns  we've searched for<br />
                that slip from  our grasp<br />
                when we think  we've got hold<br />
                of them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but seized now<br />
                this cold  night&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with urgency<br />
                we cannot  explain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we begin<br />
                to call out all  the signs<br />
                of life to one  another<br />
                fearful&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moving toward winter<br />
                that something  may be dying like<br />
          children never  having been named</p>
