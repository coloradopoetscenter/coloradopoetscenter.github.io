              <h1>The Wolves</h1>
              <p>They are there  again tonight<br />
                ahead, at the  bend in the road,<br />
                their shapes the  dark ground<br />
          of a ritual I  cannot explain</p>
              <p>the proud  silver-gray, the mottled<br />
                other, and at  the lead, as always<br />
                the strange and  powerful black<br />
          gleaming like  onyx</p>
              <p>their eyes  catching cold fire<br />
                in the beam of  my lights<br />
                as I swing into  the curve<br />
          that will turn  me away from them.</p>
              <p>Again, I brake  almost<br />
                to a stop, again  almost<br />
                step out of my  car<br />
          instinctively,  the way bodies</p>
              <p>slip out of  cocoons<br />
                or skin, but  something -<br />
                their stillness  - stops me,<br />
          that is, keeps  me moving</p>
              <p>through the  frozen night,<br />
                remembering it  is always winter<br />
                when I see them,  always<br />
          this stark  back-drop of snow.</p>
              <p>Yet I know they  must be there<br />
                in all seasons,  moving higher along<br />
                the hill,  perhaps watching among pines<br />
          until some sign  calls them down</p>
              <p>to this bend,  bright eyes dimming<br />
                as I spin away,  breaking trail<br />
                through drifts  of their silence<br />
          and this  terrible urge to stop.</p>
