  <h1>In a Heart&rsquo;s Rut</h1>  <p>Backroad</p> <p>No one drives the 1954 Dodge.<br />  rutted in-the-once-in-blue-moon-snow.</p>  <p>Shovels shoved in the air swoop<br /> downward for manure spread<br /> on the bed.<br /> <br /> Cotton puffs arc,<br /> disembodied<br /> hands shoot skyward,<br /> hold close<br /> the tufts.<br /> <br /> But he&rsquo;s watching you from the balcony.</p>  <p>Watching <br /> the tail gate<br /> with banners attached <br /> bound<br /> in the dust.</p>  <p>Rebel for sale flying.</p> <p>And waiting now, the image of him—right  boot heel<br /> carving his frown in the crumbled clods<br />  left from a day&rsquo;s checking.</p>  <p>Out of the labor of dusk, dung and  cotton,<br /> writhing in the banners an idiom  shimmers:<br /><em>Color  me corn bread</em><br /> myth dancing.<br /> <br /> For once snow could freeze drudge and  drag,<br /> salt mines bursting on the neck.</p>  <p>There&rsquo;s whistling from both windows  shot out,<br /> cottonwood-smoked language<br /> doors jammed.</p>  <p>Two trails of tin cans loaded with  pennies.  </p>  <p>In the front seat, two Creeks<br /> spooked from the license plate<br />  shaken loose by thunder.</p>  <p>How it flew<br /> to another tail gate, clipped<br /> corn ears and cotton stems<br /> along the way.<br /> <br /> The sound could&rsquo;ve been <br /> crippled<br /> lean-tos <br /> or tires <br /> edging for ruts,<br /> but this pick-up <br /> stays rooted.<br /> Rubber waiting for a long burn<br /> like the mid-summer sun.<br /> <br /> Off the side-view mirrors<br /> silver medals jangled<br /> with insignias of the white father.<br /> <br /> They glimmered <br /> on compost on the bed,<br /> wood chips set for spreading<br /> iron memories. </p>  <p>Pebbles crackled<br /> through the black gold, pop<br /> went a heat wave, boiled<br /> the whole image, blurred, bright. <br /> <br /> Or the picture was rattled<br /> by Jackson&rsquo;s trampled villages,<br /> punctured land.</p>  <p>Up front a gamble: shells of blue  turtles rolled<br /> to celebrate—hush—<br /> it was nothing.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Published by High Five Press  (previously published in <em>Fulcrum)</em></p>
