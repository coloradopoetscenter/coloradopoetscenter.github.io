              <h1>Morning In Delta</h1>
              <p>How beautiful this little morning<br />
                on the banks of the Uncompahgre,<br />
                the horses talking in shade;<br />
                the man handling peaches,<br />
                his fingers full of light.<br />
                How beautiful the habaneras,<br />
                heart-shaped lanterns<br />
                waiting to be lit,<br />
                pumpkin-colored whispers,<br />
          children hiding beneath branches.</p>
              <p>Maria y Alejandro<br />
                I am feeding your songs<br />
                to the squash and corn fields<br />
                of Western Colorado,<br />
                to the wild stones<br />
                living among purple aster<br />
          at the foot of Grand Mesa.</p>
              <p>Today I make prayers<br />
                standing on the roots<br />
                of the Ute Council Tree.<br />
                Chipeta, Ouray<br />
                I hear you saying,<br />
  &ldquo;we will live in peace.&rdquo;<br />
                See that I have also come<br />
                with my heart<br />
                in a good way,<br />
                with determination,<br />
                with mango-colored songs<br />
          from our friends in Mexico.</p>
