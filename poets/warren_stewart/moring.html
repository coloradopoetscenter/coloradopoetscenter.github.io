<h1>Morning In Delta</h1>
<p>How beautiful this little morning<br />on the banks of the Uncompahgre,<br />the horses talking in shade;<br />the man handling peaches,<br />his fingers full of light.<br />How beautiful the habaneras,<br />heart-shaped lanterns<br />waiting to be lit,<br />pumpkin-colored whispers,<br />  children hiding beneath branches.</p>
<p>Maria y Alejandro<br />I am feeding your songs<br />to the squash and corn fields<br />of Western Colorado,<br />to the wild stones<br />living among purple aster<br />  at the foot of Grand Mesa.</p>
<p>Today I make prayers<br />standing on the roots<br />of the Ute Council Tree.<br />Chipeta, Ouray<br />I hear you saying,<br />&ldquo;we will live in peace.&rdquo;<br />See that I have also come<br />with my heart<br />in a good way,<br />with determination,<br />with mango-colored songs<br />  from our friends in Mexico.</p>
