<h1>My Kind Of Colorado</h1>
<p> Kremling Colorado you&rsquo;re the crossroads<br />of thin water and evaporative sky,<br />the long stride of pterodactyls<br />just before flight.<br />Breckenridge and Silverthorne,<br />those other girls wear me out,<br />but you get in my face<br />with far away eyes,<br />willows on the watercourse,<br />a hawk for good reason.<br />I like the way you cut your hay<br />  then let the sage keep rolling;</p>
<p>The further north we drove<br />the more you opened up<br />  so I pulled over to pray:</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">Everything here begins and ends<br />with thank you.  Creator,<br />if I am anything at all<br />I am You.<br />Make me a slope of sweet clover<br />for the good of my people,<br />  show me how to share the water.</p>
<p>Keep heading north, Spirit said,<br />so we followed the power<br />to Cowdrey and Lake John.<br />You began to sing so I told you,<br />one of these days<br />I&rsquo;ll make room for everything,<br />but right now<br />  you&rsquo;re my only Colorado.</p>
