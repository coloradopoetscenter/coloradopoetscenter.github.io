<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Warren  is a writer who sees deep into the heart of this world, a writer whose voice  bounces off canyon walls and travels along rivers to their desert ends.&nbsp; One can be sure that the echo of this poet's  voice will always come back to the reader with clear, authentic and beautiful  tones. It would seem that any moment or encounter is reason enough for Warren to take pen to  paper and write heartfelt poems that linger with a reader the way all good art  should.&nbsp; Early in this collection Warren writes  &quot;Everything has become an instrument.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps there is no better description of  these poems, these poems which echo through mountain ranges, New Mexican  villages, the many colored skins of the earth and into flight with birds and  then settle so nicely back down to earth with her people and their  history.&nbsp; Warren is a lover of all that the earth  contains or lets go and these poems reflect that love.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;Aaron A. Abeyta, author of Colcha and As  Orion Falls</p>
<p>&quot;Poetry with intelligence, hard-won wisdom, humor  and humanity. Stewart S.<br />Warren's long awaited collection is an invitation to see ourselves 'in the<br />shiny mud,' to lean into one another, to get down on our  knees and to enter<br />  the house of experience.&quot; --Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer, author of If You Listen  &amp; Insatiable </p>
