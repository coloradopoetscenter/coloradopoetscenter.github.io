              <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
              
              <p>&ldquo;[Owen] has one of the most highly developed senses of  humor of any poet now writing.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>American  Book Review</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;There is no more American writer than the cosmopolite Ms.  Owen.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Galatea Resurrects</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;No one writes quite like Maureen Owen but a bunch probably  want to.&rdquo;&mdash;Bob Arnold, Longhouse Woodburners We Recommend</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Astonishing things quietly occur.&rdquo; &mdash;Paul Hoover</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Her exuberant style and tremendous energy shine in her  strongly feminist works. &rdquo;&mdash;Andrei Codrescu</p>
              
              <p>&ldquo;A book of dream-like urgency, easily read in one sitting,  full of unexpected similes and metaphors . . . Owen&rsquo;s long-lined poems convey  sharp-witted realism mingled with openhearted curiosity about nature, love, and  loss.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Entertainment Weekly</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;Few poets examine American family life, feminism, art  history, and the natural world with an underlying awareness and understanding  of both Eastern and Western spirituality and thought . . . And even in a volume  full of complicated phrasing and erudite moments, she can also offer that most  wondrous of poet&rsquo;s gifts, the lyric.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>BOMB</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;A terrific collection of poems . . . The only problem with  [<em>Erosion&rsquo;s Pull</em>] is picking a  favorite.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;Daring and agile . . . with characteristic humor,  self-deprecation, and delicacy, Owen tracks the comings and goings of the  world.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Rain Taxi</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;In <em>Erosion&rsquo;s Pull</em>,  Owen truly is at the top of her game. All her imagination&rsquo;s magic is at her  command. She can wax lyrical, switch rhythms on a dime, and rock and roll all  night. The Waltz, the Lindy Hop, did you say the Watusi?&mdash;all one to her.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Galatea Resurrects</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;The geological thrust of this selection&rsquo;s title can just  as well be applied to the structure of the poems. The successive lines  construed as strata, the linear arrangement as a mineral vein, interrupted by  happenstance or some overarching organization that yields not only a surface  meaning but indicates a deep history folded in on itself to create something  new, something revelatory, something solid.&rdquo; &mdash;<em>Poetry Flash</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;Maureen Owen is a volcanic poet. . . . Her volcanic  tendencies are not haphazard or random; instead each poem is steadily  structured and reasoned so as to remain in one place, focused on one image,  until the image either disappears, revolts, or falls off the bottom of the page  like molten lava. . . . Indeed, this a mature and dangerous writing. Watch out  for the eruption.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Altar Magazine</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;[Owen] create[s] glimpses of womanhood, artisthood, and  humanhood deserving of careful attention.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Poetry  Project Newsletter</em></p>
              <p>&ldquo;No one writes quite like Maureen Owen but a bunch probably  want to&mdash;there&rsquo;s none of that stuffy and shedding femininity and playing the  poet part . . . Her poetry has great fun to it, sensibly balanced, and it&rsquo;s  interesting. Her short poems cut an angle groove from the long poems and you  feel a texture of music and language love.&rdquo;&mdash;Longhouse, Publishers &amp;  Booksellers</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In <em>Erosion&rsquo;s Pull</em>,  Maureen Owen <br />
              epitomizes quantum poetics <br />
              or <br />
              being in 67 places at one time <br />

          The Atomizer&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &mdash;Bernadette Mayer </p>
              <p>&ldquo;In Maureen Owen&rsquo;s perfectly titled <em>Erosion&rsquo;s Pull</em>, words and lines map, unmap, and revamp our everyday  postcontemporary geographies: ironies and ambiguities, surrealistic conundrums,  kaleidoscopic comedies, puzzlements, certain and uncertain loves and  losses.&rdquo;&mdash;Susan Howe </p>
              <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Reality is the last word in illusionism&rsquo; in this poetry  &lsquo;in constant hypothesis,&rsquo; where the Virgin becomes a suspect and a way of  rhythm leads us into the &lsquo;wounded day.&rsquo; A quest for self knowledge so deep it  hurts with beauty. &lsquo;What shape rhapsody&rsquo; she asks and her images unfold like  rain in &lsquo;beaded torrents.&rsquo; Truth is &lsquo;brok en&rsquo; in, in a process un-poetic enough  for her to make poetry of it.&rdquo;&mdash;Cecilia Vicu&ntilde;a</p>
              
              <p>&ldquo;Exhilarating, pratfall funny and kick-ass sharp. . . . The  manic, high-speed quality one hears in some of these poems lends them  instantaneous presence, a being-there which guides the reader over the chasm of  the non sequiturs, the quasi-surrealist constructs and the sundry private codes  of the New York School.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Literary  Quarterly</em> (on <em>American Rush</em>)</p>
              <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve forgotten why you like poetry, pick up Maureen  Owen&rsquo;s <em>American Rush</em>. What&rsquo;s here?  Raising kids, love gone sour, clothes and food and the condition of women,  literature, Japanese and Chinese poets, driving around, the prairie, her daily  life, Blake, hugs, birds. Fresh from beginning to end.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Poetry Project Newsletter</em> (on <em>American  Rush</em>)</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Owen&rsquo;s strengths are obvious from the very first reading.  Depth and clarity of expression, swiftness of verse, effortless, confident  lyricism, honesty of emotion (not sentiment) and perception all qualify the  poems of <em>Imaginary Income</em>. . . . She  can be compared to Bonnie Raitt . . . a distinctive voice well worth hearing.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>American Book Review</em> (on <em>Imaginary Income</em>)</p>
