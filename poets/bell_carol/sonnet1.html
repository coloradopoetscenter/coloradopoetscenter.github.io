title: Carol Bell : Sonnet #1: We Live

<h1>Sonnet #1: We  Live</h1>
<p>To smell the pungent green of a  pine forest.<br />To hear cracked bells and locked  doors ringing open.<br />To taste the mustard-red of  morning and climb<br />  like kites tipping, exploring a  flash of sky.</p>
<p>To touch the sun-bright yellow  of narcissus,<br />kiss the miracle of time and  then to see,<br />in the dark moments before dawn,  a newborn<br />  straighten the crooked walk of  an old woman.</p>
<p>Still, as we run our hands along  life&rsquo;s windows,<br />we may pluck a leaf from an  ancient oak&rsquo;s bough<br />  or grab a rock from an impatient  river.</p>
<p>We may stop the flight of birds  for an instant,<br />or forget to watch our  grandfathers dancing.<br />  But surely we&rsquo;ll be forgiven our  blindness.</p>
