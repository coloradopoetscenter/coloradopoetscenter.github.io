<h1>The Bullpen Bar</h1>
<p>What you have to understand <br />is the place where your father  and I drank beer<br />when we were seventeen.<br />The Bullpen Bar was a worn-out  building<br />on the edge of Sulfur City<br />where a handful of people  drowned their nights.<br />It hung on a cliff overlooking  the river.<br />One tree stood beside it, <br />flinging its crooked arms<br />over the bar roof on one side <br />  and the Sasqwa River  on the other.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t drink inside the bar, <br />but outside, <br />under the tree<br />  with rough planks scratching our  backs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we&rsquo;d climb down the  cliff <br />and settle on our small spot of  ground <br />hemmed in by sandstone and  river. <br />Daniel would slip his hands <br />under my blouse<br />as we listened to the water slap <br />  against the banks.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The night Kennedy was shot,<br />Daniel and I huddled <br />against icy, November rocks.<br />The moon was a half-ball in the  sky.<br />I wore red cowboy boots.<br />  Daniel wore his black leather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t swim across it,&rdquo; he taunted, <br />swallowing the last of his Bud.<br />He didn&rsquo;t know that after Oswald <br />  nothing was impossible.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>I slipped into the beetle-black  water,<br />sinking low and swimming hard.<br />When I surfaced,<br />I heard Daniel call.<br />I turned and found him<br />with water writhing <br />around his face<br />  like a serpent.</p>
<p>Its thick scales caught the  moonlight<br />And threw it back at me.<br />&nbsp;<br />I tried to reach him as he  wrestled,<br />but the water was seething.<br />When he disappeared,<br />I begged for more light, <br />begged for the strength to find  him, <br />  begged for the sound of his voice. </p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>You have to understand.<br />Tonight, we sit by an innocent  fountain <br />and drink expensive wine<br />in this bar that isn&rsquo;t anything <br />  like the Bullpen.</p>
<p>At the Bullpen,<br />people didn&rsquo;t sit close to a  fountain pool,<br />so close they could see  themselves in the water,<br />so close they could make a wish, <br />watch the pool swallow their  coins, <br />  and then just walk away.</p>
