              <h1>Away</h1>
              <p>I leave the coffee shop at City College  and drive<br />
                the shortest route home through  the projects.<br />
                Snow travels with me<br />
                opening my eyes<br />
                to midnight on Centennial Street<br />
          as my car slips to a stop in  front of a dilapidated house.</p>
              <p>I stare at an easy chair slumped  against the house,<br />
                at rags rotting in the gutter. I  start to drive<br />
                away but instead become a  prisoner of Centennial Street<br />
                as the storm slowly covers the  projects.<br />
                I&rsquo;ve driven through before, but  always with blind eyes.<br />
          Now, the storm teases me</p>
              <p>by covering the world and  dancing around me.<br />
                Rags transform into lace, the  house <br />
                and chair huddle into perfect  white, dazzling my eyes.<br />
                I notice the heat inside my car  and wonder, S<em>hould I drive?</em><br />
                But I ache to touch every part  of the projects,<br />
          to abandon my car and run  through the street,</p>
              <p>to devour the night-bright  street,<br />
                and revel in the ivory corners  surrounding me.<br />
                I want the snow that masks the  projects,<br />
                that masks Centennial Street and the house,<br />
                to last. I want the storm to  drive<br />
          the sun away, to stop the sun&rsquo;s  morning eyes</p>
              <p>from melting the magic now  hovering before my eyes.<br />
                I beg tomorrow&rsquo;s sun not to  steal lace from the street.<br />
                I grip the steering wheel. <em>I&rsquo;ll  drive.</em><br />
                Instead, I wait and imagine the  sun staring at me,<br />
                at the broken houses,<br />
          and chairs in the projects.</p>
              <p>                I know if it finds me in these  projects,<br />
                my eyes<br />
                will recognize the dilapidated  house<br />
                as it emerges from its Centennial Street,<br />
                midnight blanket. Then nothing  will free me<br />
          from recognizing the lies. <em>I  must drive.</em></p>
              <p>Yet, leaving the projects in  transcendent white can&rsquo;t free me<br />
                from the decrepit house, the  broken street,<br />
          or from recognizing the deceit  my eyes see. <em>I can&rsquo;t drive.</em></p>
