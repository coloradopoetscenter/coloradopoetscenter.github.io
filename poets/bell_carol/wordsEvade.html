              <h1>When Words Evade Me</h1>
              <p>I gnash <br />
                my teeth,<br />
                fidget, worry<br />
          my fingers together&mdash;apart.</p>
              <p>Then I pace<br />
                around and around.<br />
                I stop, start,<br />
                force myself <br />
                to stare out the window at the  hogback<br />
                spread like a giant knotted rope<br />
          across a lapis sky.</p>
              <p>The ridges of the hogback  resemble<br />
                the lumps of grey matter<br />
                I imagine<br />
          compose my brain&mdash;twisted,  impossible to navigate.</p>
              <p>I move<br />
                closer to the window glass,<br />
                cold against my palm,<br />
                and notice the light, inching  from the west&mdash;<br />
                a giant waddle of gold-red <br />
                rambling over the hills,<br />
                forming itself to each twist of  rope,<br />
          each curve of grey matter.</p>
              <p>Still, words withhold themselves<br />
                as if they don&rsquo;t exist,<br />
                as if the slow, painful tread of  man&mdash;<br />
                from non-speaker to speaker&mdash;<br />
          is a dream.</p>
