              <h1>Biography
              </h1>
              <p>After studying a  dual major in Biology and Chemistry at the University of Colorado in the 1970s,  Bell worked for many years as a pharmaceutical chemist in Denver. Then, she  threw away the beakers, gas chromatographs and titrations so she could move to  Colorado&rsquo;s Western Slope where she now lives with her husband, Orlyn. Since the  move, her life has been filled with grassy pastures, horses, hay fields,  blackbirds, and writing. Leaving the pristine predictability of chemistry for the  gritty life of writing and living with the rhythms of the land and seasons has  been, for her, like leaving her left arm behind and finding her right.</p>
              <p> She co-founded  the Glenwood Springs, Colorado Writer&rsquo;s Workshop with Karen Chamberlain in 1999  and continues as co-facilitator. She also completed a BA in English With a  Writing Emphasis at Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colorado in 2002 and  offers readings and conducts writing workshops at various venues.</p>
              <p> Her writing is  guided by a need to understand complex issues and by her perception of the  world as a place of infinite beauty and erratic demands. Her poetry and short  stories can be found in various publications including <em>Hard Roe to Hoe</em>, <em>Mad  Blood, Inklings</em>, <em>Literary Review</em>, <em>Mountain Gazette, </em>and<em> Marginalia</em>.  Her poetry has also appeared in several anthologies including <em>The Geography  of Hope: Poets of Colorado&rsquo;s Western Slope, The 2002 Emily Dickinson Awards  Anthology,</em> and<em> Open Windows 2005 and 2006</em>. </p>
