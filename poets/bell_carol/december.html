<h1>December 31, 1999&mdash;A Nebraska  Pantoum </h1>
<p> To the east sprawls a flat,  snow-clad horizon, infinity long. <br />Above the horizon&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />slate-colored clouds, thick as  tallow,<br />  extend around the sky.</p>
<p>Also above the horizon<br />a thin slice in the clouds  cradles yellow-blue. <br />It extends half way around the  sky <br />  and is streaked with a red echo  from the sinking sun.</p>
<p>This thin slice in the clouds<br />is where the moon raises her head  and grows fat <br />by drinking streaks of the sun&rsquo;s  red echo,<br />  and as the moon gathers color</p>
<p>she continues to fatten, <br />metamorphosing into red and white  luminescence.<br />Then, having gathered enough  color,<br />  she begins to throw it around the  sky. </p>
<p>Her red and white luminescence  blends<br />with yellow-blue to awaken pinks,  purples, oranges.<br />These swirl around the sky,<br />  creating an April morning:</p>
<p>yellows, blues, reds, whites,  pinks, purples, oranges<br />caught in alchemy,<br />and April morning transforms&nbsp; <br />  December night. </p>
<p>Caught in alchemy,<br />my eyes wander, exploring the  light<br />in this December night. <br />I breathe pigment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />As the light wanders, exploring  my face,<br />it hovers before me, above me,  behind me.<br />I taste pigment,<br />  search for tulips.</p>
<p>Snow flickers before me, above me,  behind me, <br />but I hear the returning wren&rsquo;s  voice<br />and smell morning rain on tulip  petals.<br />  I&rsquo;m drunk with the spring-winter  brew.</p>
<p>I listen to the returning wren&rsquo;s  voice<br />winding through slate-colored  clouds thick as tallow.<br />I&rsquo;m drunk with the spring-winter  brew <br />  as my eyes drift back to the  flat, snow-clad horizon, infinity long.</p>
