          <h1>Notes on Arrogance</h1>
          <p>Reshuffling  itself over and over again, I, <em>the I</em>,<br />
            Better  than Elvis coming<br />
            Out of the mouth of Jesus,<br />
            Knowing  the fame that comes only from death.</p>
          <p>You  explain.</p>
          <p>Something  muddy in the street rises<br />
            In  a fiery madness beyond pretense, says:<br />
            I  transcend.<br />
            Noticing  itself, falls back from air to mud. </p>
          <p>The  trees have imagined me.<br />
            The  trees allow me.<br />
            I  chop them down. </p>
          <p>I  kiss Martyr, mother of God, on the lips.<br />
            Later,  with no reflection in the mirror, ask,<br />
            Where  has she gone?</p>
          <p>I  am nothing. <br />
            She  has form: grit under the fingernails.<br />
            I  have imagined her.</p>
          <p>The  trees have imagined their own death.</p>
          <p>A  tree has been enchanted. It dwells <br />
            In  the woods near no village.<br />
            The  treetop covered with emeralds and amethyst.<br />
            Roots  tangled, black mouths.</p>
          <p>Something  hides in the mirror, muddy in her mind.<br />
            Adorned  with ornaments, I am Mary, I kiss the mirror.<br />
            It  rises to the rustle of wings.</p>
          <p>Nothing  between the stars and the treetops <br />
            But  enchantment.<br />
            Nothing  between us but space.<br />
            I  am better than you.          </p>
