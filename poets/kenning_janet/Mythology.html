</ul>  <h1>Mythology</h1>  <p><em>—  after Tomaz Salamun </em></p>  <p>She is  thunderhead, striking down the tall trees. <br /> She lies with  crying babies, rescues them from monsters.</p>  <p>We look at her  with wonder and amazement.<br /> Perhaps she is  seashore, grains of sand.<br /> She is a  goddess or oak tree.<br /> We wish her  well that she does not stumble in her robes. </p>  <p>Maybe she is  just a bit of iron pyrite, which will <br /> Fool a miner  into his pocket.<br /> He will later  brush this gold onto a tin plate, <br /> And see his  death.</p>  <p>Traitor to  something, her head <br /> Should be  mounted on a spiked fence <br /> At the  outskirts of the village.<br /> Maybe she is a  suffragette, reborn. <br /> She might warn  outsiders that something is amiss.<br /> In the village  market, she might shout about money or taxes.</p>  <p>She should be put  in a glass jar, <br /> Her brain  measured, her<br /> Genetic code  decoded.<br /> Next spring,  she might be in Oaxaca, <br /> For <em>la Dia de los  Muertos</em>.  She will burn candles, <br /> Sing  songs.  Perhaps she&rsquo;ll go to Moscow, <br /> Where children  in fur hats will hold her hand <br /> And give her  licorice. </p>  <p>If she goes to  Washington, they&rsquo;ll say <br /> <em>&ldquo;There she goes, did you see her? </em><br /> <em>She touched the iron gates, stopped near  that tree.  </em><br /> <em>She stood across the street at that bus  stop.  </em><br /> <em>And there, over there, she bought the  newspaper.&rdquo; </em></p>  <p>Originally appeared in <em>Margie</em></p>
