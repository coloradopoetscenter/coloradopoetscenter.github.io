</ul>  <h1>Junkyard </h1>  <p>Dented in,  riding on the back of a flatbed truck<br /> Like the  carcass of a whale, the wings buckled down behind it,<br /> Blackened and  tragic, <br /> This morning on  the Interstate, a small plane <br />  Passed me in  the next lane. </p>  <p>The pilot  could&rsquo;ve looked at me,<br /> At my car, his  eyes in terror, knowing no way <br /> To stop the  wing from dipping down, touching, <br /> Just slightly,  the asphalt.Â  An exit, left <br /> Behind certain  sadness and loss. <br /> So I drove on,  more slowly than before,<br /> To work, to the  monotony of everyday living, <br /> And arriving  there, could think of nothing but flying.</p>  <p>Originally  appeared in <em>Vintage Colorado Poetry </em></p>
