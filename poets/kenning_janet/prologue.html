          <h1>Prologue: At my Door</h1>
          <p>We  entered as dots in a sentence. Through turnstiles,<br />
            With badges, white noise, white paper, <br />
            Where  old white men, animal in their desires, <br />
            Prehistoric in their longing, blank, bland, <br />
            Worried  emptiness. We thumbtacked <br />
            Sunday's comics, lit a bright shrine <br />
            Where  Lucy tempted Charlie Brown,<br />
            Pulled the football away, never gave him a chance. <br />
            Gone.  Still you see her on the corner. Her voice,<br />
            Passes with a stranger. Lucy, off-key, sang hopeful in sitcoms,<br />
            Dyed  her hair red for love; Madame X. <br />
            Broke and broken, a rift of congas, <br />
            A  newspaper, a hat. Scientific, with<br />
            Goddess garb, straight from the stockbroker, <br />
            Wings  burnt, trapped in the turn of a phrase, <br />
            Sold like a Barbie-doll, feeble, wrinkled,<br />
            American  in her longingâ€”her desire to succeed, <br />
            Proud in her rags, supping on peanut butter. <br />
            Later,  a grocery parking lot, daylight and sleep,<br />
            And the dreaming sleep, the long sleep between <br />
            Night  and darkness. <br />
            I am Eve. <br />
            Men  blame tragedy on women,<br />
            Fed our fingers to the scaled-snake.<br />
            Mother  of Cain and Abel.<br />
            I am Eve, rejecting the names Adam gave, <br />
            Naming  all things anew. <br />
            I begin with Lucy.</p>
