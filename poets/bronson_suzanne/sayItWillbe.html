<h1>Say It Will  Be</h1>
<p></p>
<p> Say there  will come a time</p>
<p> When my  hair will lie across his breast</p>
<p> And I will  hear his heart beating</p>
<p> Instead of  it calling to mine</p>
<p> At a  distance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Say there  will come a time</p>
<p> When I will  know</p>
<p> The taste  of his mouth</p>
<p> And I can  give myself to him</p>
<p> With  quivering emotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Say there  will come a time</p>
<p> When he  will say my name</p>
<p> Above the  tension and the ecstasy</p>
<p> And I will  know his love in return <br />From the  look in his eyes.</p>
