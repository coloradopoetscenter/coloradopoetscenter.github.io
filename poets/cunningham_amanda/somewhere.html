<h1>somewhere among the graves</h1>
<p>they rang around the roses<br />and burned the plague for its ashes<br />for what happened when the<br />black bells rang in the Sabbath?<br />i took the cross as a stake in my heart<br />they found me walking through the kirkyard<br />not that i felt kin with the dead <br />but with the stone<br />  for the theses lie in the stone</p>
<p>i cannot resist stained glass<br />and its holy light<br />red as a vampire&rsquo;s teeth and<br />blue as the honest sky<br />in here i wear no memento mori<br />as a black veil over my eyes<br />since i somehow misplaced it<br />  somewhere among the graves</p>
