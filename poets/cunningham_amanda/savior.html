<h1>of a savior</h1>
<p>then i come to a place <br />where the sky is always empty<br />and trees are wrung like rags<br />from the wind<br />the earth sweats only the scent<br />of warm dead weeds and dry wood<br />water waits in little rock basins<br />lined with pale green lichen<br />bare grey scrub oak crowds<br />over the hillsides like the thorns around<br />sleeping beauty&rsquo;s castle<br />where for her foolishness<br />she is left to the mercy<br />  of a savior</p>
<p>(<em>The Crucible, #16)</em></p>
