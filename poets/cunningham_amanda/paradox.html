              <h1>paradox: success</h1>
              <p>with grace comes assurance<br />
                partial salvation is no salvation at all<br />
          there is no such thing as possibility</p>
              <p>cast all your cares on him like stones<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they will  bounce off like the beer bottle<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i kept  throwing at the trunk of an electric tree<br />
                NO<br />
                they will crush his bones<br />
                he will crumple on the ground and petrify into a<br />
                stone filling the whole earth and crying out<br />
                to the glory of God the Father<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amen</p>
              <p>the dog<br />
                is only as good as his owner<br />
                no wonder i hate him with such pity<br />
                and they blame me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they blame him<br />
          anyone but themselves</p>
              <p>a wise woman once said<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snap out of  it<br />
                but my bootstraps are tore clean off from<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pulling</p>
              <p>what color is your pill reminder?<br />
                mine&rsquo;s purple</p>
              <p>here we go</p>
              <p>you really were the only one in the world that day<br />
                i know<br />
                you only thought you were happy dead<br />
                just like when you were alive<br />
          failure was the only heaven you would ever know</p>
              <p>(from <em>IMPROV)</em></p>
