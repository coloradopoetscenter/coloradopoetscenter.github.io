<h1>crossed fingers</h1>
<p>they can keep their prenups<br />(and their misery wedding cakes<br />rotting in the freezer for a year)<br />i prefer sacred geometry<br />i think you do too<br />(call me optimistic<br />call me na&iuml;ve)<br />you and me stranger<br />have got it made already<br />&mdash;i think you are pure<br />like the engraving on a new<br />bar of soap i didn&rsquo;t expect<br />to be so perfect and was<br />reluctant to scrub off&mdash;<br />they want me to expect<br />disappointment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;maybe<br />but they can keep their <br />crossed fingers (wondering casually<br />if they will eat the cake<br />or hate each other first)<br />because you<br />will never wear thin enough<br />to slip through the slots<br />  in the soap dish</p>
<p>(<em>The Crucible, #15)</em></p>
