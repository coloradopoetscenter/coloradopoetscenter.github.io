              <h1>Critical Commentary </h1>
              <p>&ldquo;Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer&rsquo;s lyrical poetry is written with such precision and economy of language that readers will want to slowly absorb her every image and metaphor. Trommer writes of &lsquo;symphonies of snowstorms,&rsquo; the &lsquo;soprano of starlight,&rsquo; and the entire score of nature&rsquo;s sounds that are secret unless listened to deliberately &lsquo;day after day.&rsquo; &rdquo; <strong><em>&ndash;Rocky Mountain News </em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em> &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
              <p> &ldquo;Trommer&rsquo;s poems amuse, others cause introspection. They include nuance and life lessons </p>
              <p> from weeds and snow, rocks and frogs. Trommer is witty and enjoyable to read.&rdquo; </p>

              <p><strong><em> &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
              <p> &ldquo;[<em>If You Listen</em>] is a small book with a big message, a book to keep by the reading chair so it can be picked up often. A great gift book or quiet meditation book to keep all for yourself.&rdquo; <strong>&ndash; <em>Bloomsbury</em><em> Review </em></strong></p>

              <p> &ldquo;Charming sorcery. &hellip; Trommer possesses a nicely tuned sense of human emotions and their echoes in the natural world. When so many writers have turned a cynical eye toward love and passion, she celebrates our deep need for these powerful energies. One of the strongest poetry performers west of the Pecos.&rdquo; <strong>&ndash; <em>Telluride Magazine</em></strong></p>

              <p> &ldquo;The room was spellbound. It was a pleasure to see the faces of the audience as Rosemerry&rsquo;s words provided the space for them to reflect. Many told me afterwards that the session sparked their creative imaginations as to possibilities for their own lives. Any group that&rsquo;s committed to self-discovery and basking in the wonder of the world should bring Rosemerry into their midst. &rdquo; </p>

              <p> &ldquo;I have really improved my poetry skills and felt safe and honored so it was easy to open up. I definitely got my money&rsquo;s worth. &rdquo; </p>

              <p> &ldquo;I wanted to let you know how much I LOVED your workshop. It was easily the best of the weekend for me personally because it allowed me some personal growth that I plan to build on. That is what I was hoping for and that it what actually happened.&rdquo; </p>

              <h2>ABOUT <em>HOLDING  THREE THINGS AT ONCE</em><br />
                (Turkey Buzzard Press, 2008)</h2>
              <p>Excerpts from a review by John Nizalowski in <em>Telluride Magazine</em>, Winter 2008-2009:</p>
              <p>&ldquo; &hellip; her finest writing yet. While familiar Trommer  themes appear in this book&mdash;love, family, nature, self-knowledge&mdash;we find richer  imagery, deeper metaphors and sharper details in this latest work. Apparently,  Trommer has recently experienced a visionary metamorphosis that has made an  already-superb poet even better. &hellip;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;&hellip;Trommer has been mining religion and mythology for  potent thematic and descriptive material. In &lsquo;Some Nights, Although I Am  Faithless,&rsquo; she fuses prayer, fear and forest fires: &lsquo;Tonight I&rsquo;d rather fuss  and dust than pray, / as if to shine could be intransitive. / Outside, the  wildfire ash makes starlight stiff. / Inside, the prayers billow anyway.&rsquo; The  poem &lsquo;Eve Composes a letter to Her Mother&rsquo; displays Trommer&rsquo;s wit, in this case  intertwined with a fascinating concept that turns Genesis on its side, with Eve  contemplating the characteristics of her mother. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve guessed about the color  of your eyes, / and wondered if my face is shaped like yours.&rsquo;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The book&rsquo;s heart rests in the section entitled &lsquo;How  Soon Language Slips,&rsquo; which explores the limitation so language, an ironic subject  for a poet with an MA in linguistics. &hellip; Trommer&rsquo;s examination of language and  its boundaries reach an apex in the poem &lsquo;Ars Poetica.&rsquo; Evoking&nbsp; a famous  sermon of Buddha&rsquo;s during which he said nothing for two hours and then held up  a flower, Trommer admits that &lsquo;no vocabulary rivals&rsquo; that wordless revelation.  Nonetheless, as a poet, Trommer&rsquo;s sacred task is to illuminate the world  through words: &lsquo;Still, I thrill at the pleasure of naming, / the joy of the  verb unfurling /&nbsp; from primitive places below the belly / before spiraling  into the ear -- / yes, here is the toil of the poet &hellip;.&rsquo; Considering the beauty  of her work, all that one can say to Trommer is, &lsquo;Toil on, please.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
