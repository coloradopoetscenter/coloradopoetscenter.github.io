<h1>13.7 Billion Years in the Making</h1>
<p>Bless the body, its belly of moon,</p>
<p>and bless the electric pulse coursing through it</p>
<p>that links us back to a bigger bang.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bless each long finger and each stubby toe, </p>
<p>the long arms for reaching, the legs for dancing</p>
<p>and the smooth cupped yes of breast,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>the thin hairs that stand at attention when thrilled or cold</p>
<p>and the skin that stretches like praise across the living bones.</p>
<p>Bless the tongue for its pink curiosity</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>and the back of the knee for its vulnerability.</p>
<p>Bless the long spine, that sterling strand where desire meets curve,</p>
<p>and the ornery elbow that knows how to hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>And what is it in us that knows how to laugh? </p>
<p>Bless that, and the ridiculous brain that wants to control,</p>
<p>and bless the tears that well up whenever they want to</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>reminding us that we&rsquo;ve come from water,</p>
<p>that every movement of the body baptizes us into the moment</p>
<p>and that gratitude is our birthright.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
