          <h1>Waiting the Diagnosis</h1>
          <p>I bow to the ache of it, <br />
            the deep inner eating<br />
            away at itself, I bow <br />
            to the shivers, the gooseflesh, <br />
            the waves of nausea and pain. <br />
            I bow to the unnamed, <br />
            to question, to dark.<br />
            And I bow to the fear<br />
            that swells in small spaces<br />
            and the vast quiet<br />
            that dissipates the fear. <br />
            I bow to every other human<br />
            who hurts and I bow<br />
            to the yellow flowers tonight<br />
            blooming in the muck<br />
            where the river used to be.<br />
            I bow to the ache, goddammit, <br />
            I bow to it and I bow<br />
            to the reluctance to bow to it, <br />
            bow to the longing to shove<br />
            it all away, and I bow, <br />
          hush now, just bow. </p>
