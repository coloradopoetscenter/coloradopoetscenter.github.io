<h1>Eve Composes a Letter  to Her Mother</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve guessed about the color of your eyes, <br />and if my slender face is shaped like yours. <br />I seldom think about you anymore<br />now that the boys are taking all my time. <br />But still, sometimes I wish your voice would twine<br />into my own; I&rsquo;d hear some echo or<br />a resonance of things you&rsquo;d said before.<br />  No thread. The only voice I hear is mine. </p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m lucky not to have the ink<br />of your blood spill through me, I tend to write<br />my own mistakes, no other hand to blame. <br />But late at night, the boys asleep, I think<br />about the silent pages of your life<br />  and how I wear that emptiness like chains. &nbsp;</p>
