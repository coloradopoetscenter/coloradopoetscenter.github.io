              <h1><strong>Choose Headlong</strong></h1>
              <p>Somewhere between<br />
                moment and mind<br />
          is a line.</p>
              <p>I picture it red,<br />
                and it appears <br />
          here, now,</p>
              <p>and reads in an endless, infinitely small script,<br />
  &ldquo;make a choice, make a choice, make a choice, make a  choice.&rdquo;<br />
          We cannot see the other side.</p>
              <p>Where has it been?<br />
                Was it here yesterday, flouncing along<br />
          the invisible edge of no and yes?</p>
              <p>Did it hide in the accordion folds of now?<br />
                And shall we cross it?<br />
          Meanwhile, between tonight and starlight</p>
              <p>10,000 times 10,000 more choices appear,<br />
                some clear.<br />
          Most we never see.</p>
              <p>And some become lines, like this one, <br />
                which has fallen on the floor in front of us,<br />
          a thin red stripe that invites.</p>
              <p>And so we toe the moment.<br />
                And what? Retreat?<br />
          Run headlong and leap?</p>
              <p>Or waltz another round<br />
                on the shrinking stage of maybe,<br />
          this once-comfortable place</p>
              <p>where feet still know<br />
                at least for now, <br />
          which step comes next.</p>
