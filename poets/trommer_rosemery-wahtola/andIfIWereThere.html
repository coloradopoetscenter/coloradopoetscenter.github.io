<h1>And if I Were There, I Would Hold You and Not Say  Anything</h1>
<p>It is not enough that we love. <br />It is not enough to hold each other<br />when shadows multiply.&nbsp; <br />Then there is always fate. <br />  And then there is always law. </p>
<p>I travel inside your heart and hear weeping.<br />You let me walk in your gardens of hope<br />and I watch the flowers fail. <br />Sometimes rain refuses to come.<br />Sometimes sun is too much with us. <br />And sometimes it&rsquo;s just not enough<br />that we planted a seed and tended it daily<br />and weeded, fertilized and prayed. <br />The seedling might die anyway. <br />And we might never know why.<br /><br />But if we don&rsquo;t grow flowers,<br />thorns come in. <br />And when we don&rsquo;t grow gardens,<br />  we build prisons. </p>
<p>It is not enough that we love, <br />and we must love anyway. <br />And when it is cold, we must hold each other. <br />And when it is time, we must let go. <br />And when shadows come in, <br />I will not run from your sorrow.<br />I will travel with you as far as you let me,<br />I will walk with you as long as you go. <br />I will hold your hand, knowing it isn&rsquo;t enough.<br />And when it rains I will dance in your puddles. <br />I will dance with you on your fallen blooms,<br />I will dance with you in your dimming light.<br />And when night swallows us with its cold, cold tongues<br />  I will dance with you in the prisons we build.</p>
<p>And listen to me: be awake. <br />All around us, blessings drop like meteors<br />and fires escape their&nbsp;rings.&nbsp; <br />And wanting to help is the secret cup<br />that spills pleasure and purpose and salve.<br />And love, I know, is not enough, <br />  but love is&nbsp;what we have. </p>
