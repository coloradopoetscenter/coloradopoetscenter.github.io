<h1><strong>Blossoming</strong></h1>
<p>  for my son</p>
<p>Deer love to eat the soft leaves and tender bark<br />of this lilac we planted for you two years past.<br />A scraggly thing, its branches consumed&mdash;<br />save a few tips of scrappy green. <br />  It has no chance for blossoming.</p>
<p>Part of me yearns for purple scent, <br />heady and sweet, full green foliage. <br />The other part savors this thin trunk of you, <br />how your lean-muscled body fits snug <br />  in the bowl of my arms. </p>
<p>Someday, celebrating your flowering,<br />this lilac, so gangly, so sparse,<br />will have deepened its roots and grown enough blooms<br />to spare a generous bouquet for the table. <br />  How I will hate to enjoy it alone. </p>
