  <h1><strong>Picking Up a Hitchhiker  in May</strong></h1>  <p><em>The  burial of the dead is Humanity 101.</em><br />  <em>—Thomas Lynch,  undertaker and poet</em> </p>  <p>It&rsquo;s messy when they die<br /> in winter, he says. The dirt<br /> is too cold to work with then. <br /> I tell him I will consider this<br /> when I die. Just give me two-weeks&rsquo;<br /> notice, he says, quoting a joke,<br /> and it occurs to me humor<br /> must be an unwritten <br /> prerequisite for a grave digger. <br /> I ask him what he thinks<br /> about the recent uproar in Boston, <br /> no one wanting the bomber<br /> buried in their own backyard. <br /> Well, he says, I&rsquo;ve always thought<br /> we should have a special section<br /> for the politicians. We could put<br /> him here with them—in a place where <br /> we let the dogs run. <br /> In the space before I laugh,<br /> I remember the story<br /> the undertaker told about how<br /> in the middle ages they considered<br /> suicide the ultimate crime. <br /> But since you can&rsquo;t punish a dead man,<br /> they took out their ire on his corpse<br /> and buried it at a crossroads<br /> to be trod on forever. He said,<br />&ldquo;If we do not take care of dead humans,<br /> we become less human ourselves.&rdquo;<br /> The man next to me says, <br />&ldquo;You know, I give every person I bury<br /> the gravedigger&rsquo;s promise.&rdquo;<br /> We are almost to the cemetery gate.<br />&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m the last person who&rsquo;s ever gonna<br /> let you down, and the last one<br /> who&rsquo;ll ever throw dirt on you.&rdquo;<br /> He laughs a laugh so real <br />  I can smell the earth thawing in it.</p>
