              <h1><strong>May Day, 2004 </strong></h1>
              <p><em>&ldquo;Memory&mdash;what is it? And can I get to it?&rdquo; &ndash;Gregory McGuire </em></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Before you know what memory is, </p>
              <p>you must stop moving, preferably</p>
              <p>finding a seat in the sunlight outdoors,</p>
              <p>perhaps on a squared railroad tie, </p>
              <p>its brown grain weathered to white. </p>
              <p>Does the tie remember when it was a tree, </p>
              <p>what it felt like to reach for sun, </p>
              <p>to surrender its leaves to drought? </p>
              <p>You can&rsquo;t know this, only suppose. </p>
              <p>All you can know is the pile of pulled dandelions</p>
              <p>wilting on the gray sidewalk beside you; </p>
              <p>one of the flowers has gone to seed, </p>
              <p>its unspent white wishes nestled </p>
              <p>into the bed of green stems and forked leaves. </p>
              <p>Does the dandelion recall when it was golden</p>
              <p>and plump? What orange song would it sing? </p>
              <p>But this is imagination, the twin sister of memory, </p>
              <p>the longing to know what we are unable to see. </p>
              <p>It is the hunger for tastes no longer in our mouths.</p>
              <p>In January, it is the ache for the green bittersweet </p>
              <p>of asparagus; in October for the bulbous red celebration </p>
              <p>of raspberries fresh from the side of the road;</p>
              <p>when the lover has gone, it is the thirst for the salt of his neck. </p>
              <p>Before you know memory, you must see</p>
              <p>how imagination travels everywhere with her. </p>
              <p>As soon as you walk away from the iris leaves, </p>
              <p>you wonder, were they really like fat green tongues </p>
              <p>licking up toward the alder, or were they slender spears? </p>
              <p>Were there buds just about to bloom? And come next week, </p>
              <p>you may not recall that you saw the iris leaves at all. </p>
