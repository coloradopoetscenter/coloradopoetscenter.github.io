<h1>So I Keep On  Reckoning</h1>  <p>Let&rsquo;s say that in this equation, x equals listening. <br /> And y equals the velvet of your  hand <br />  on my inner knee.  And z equals</p>  <p>a widening gap in the clouds where the blue leaks through. <br /> And then p is the tongue. And q is a  road of 379 miles,<br /> and r is the rate  of what a song does in an empty room. </p>  <p>I don&rsquo;t know. What I&rsquo;m saying is that I&rsquo;ve been trying<br /> to solve the problem, but the  variables<br /> keep changing. And  where does dirt come into this?</p>  <p>Where the Brazil nut, the pelican with wings dredged in oil,<br /> the wildfire devouring McKenzie  Springs?<br /> My paper is  covered in pink eraser rubbings—</p>  <p>breathe, I think. Go slow. I try to remember the rules. <br /> But already x equals independence. <br /> And y equals  flaxen light. And z equals</p>  <p>the river, swollen. And u <br /> is my hands in your hair. And f  equals <br /> a dial tone. M  equals fear. And j equals </p>  <p>the way I sometimes imagine an answer might<br /> appear if I try hard enough. And o  is the sound of ripening peaches.<br /> No, o is the  spider web in the pane. </p>  <p>No, o is oh, god, I don&rsquo;t know. And k is the velocity <br /> of a falcon when it falls, falls,  falls<br /> and then surges up  just before hitting earth.</p>  <p>And b is the room still doused in darkness<br /> before we slowly open the blinds<br /> to reveal twice as  much sky  </p>  <p>as the equation called for, and so many ravens.<br /> Nothing is ever equal. And already <br /> the formula is not  the same as it was </p>  <p>one yes ago, one love ago, one here ago, <br /> one x ago when x equaled morning<br /> and y was a siren  and z was slowly dissolving into white.</p>
