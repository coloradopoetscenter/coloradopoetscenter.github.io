  <h1>Attempt</h1>  <p><em>I can't grasp it, but  I am so very glad.</em><br /> <em>â€”Franz Wright, &ldquo;A Word for Joy&rdquo;</em> </p>  <p>The weight of love,<br /> it is sometimes,<br />  to the ounce,</p>  <p>the weight of a man<br /> as he rests<br /> his body on yours.</p>  <p>Though if there is sorrow<br /> or sickness in his thoughts,<br /> the gravity can flatten you.</p>  <p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s<br /> heavier than that, the weight,<br /> as if he first hems his pants </p>  <p>with lead and then<br /> finds his way to your arms.<br /> And sometimes it&rsquo;s heavier</p>  <p>even than that, as if<br /> the very air in his lungs<br /> has millions of pockets, </p>  <p>all of them filled <br /> with dull <br /> gray stones.</p>  <p>And sometimes<br /> the weight of love<br /> is no weight at all,</p>  <p>is less than a blade<br /> of orchard grass, <br /> less than a note</p>  <p>hummed in quiet rooms,<br /> less than a memory,<br /> less than the scent </p>  <p>of lilac or rose,<br /> more like the light<br /> that lands on the hand</p>  <p>and invites it to open,<br /> to hold what never<br /> can be held.</p>
