              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>Poet Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer  &ldquo;is a chanteuse of the heart,&rdquo; says poet Art Goodtimes. Trommer and Goodtimes  co-host Telluride&rsquo;s monthly Poetry Club. She served two terms as San Miguel  County&rsquo;s first poet laureate and worked ten years as director of the Telluride  Writers Guild. She has authored and edited thirteen books, and her work has  appeared on A Prairie Home Companion, in <em>O  Magazine</em>, on back alley fences, in her children&rsquo;s lunchboxes, and on rocks  she leaves around town. She won the ACC Writer&rsquo;s Studio Poetry Contest in 2011  and 2013. <br />
                <br />
Rosemerry leads writing workshops for hospice, recovery programs, women&rsquo;s  groups, teachers, schools, writers groups and people who think they hate  poetry. She performs with a poetry troupe (EAR), sings with an 8-woman a  cappella group, and leads (for 15 years) a poetry discussion series. She works  part time for Parents As Teachers as a parent educator. She earned her master&rsquo;s  degree in English Language &amp; Linguistics from University of Wisconsin—Madison. </p>
