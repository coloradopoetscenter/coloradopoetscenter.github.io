              <h1>Readings / Workshop Availability</h1>
          <p>Because  it&rsquo;s fun. That&rsquo;s the first reason. And because poetry helps us reshape how we  see ourselves and the world. That&rsquo;s why, since 1994, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer  has enjoyed sharing poetic exploration in workshops, performances and  interactive assemblies. She blends her love of language—her master&rsquo;s degree is  in English Language and Linguistics—with her deep enthusiasm for education to  create playful, engaging workshops. </p>
