  <h1>Caddis</h1>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>I  lay a long time in the visual river,<br /> between  leaf-matter and the black rush, in a body-</p>  <p>cast  of sand sinewed together. I let<br /> the  river into my house, into slits</p>  <p>in  feathery gills, my wordless siblings stuck<br /> to  rock beside me. We lay between</p>  <p>what  the river meant and what it means, its syntax<br /> a  tongue where our mother&rsquo;s wings dissolved</p>  <p>like  rice-paper. Over and over,<br /> light  congealed in atom-strands of water; meanwhile,</p>  <p>God&rsquo;s  motif hardened inside meâ€”<br /> first,  the imprint of wings in loose molecules,</p>  <p>and  then filmy wings. When I could stay<br /> in  and under no longer, the mirror</p>  <p>rivered  itself and I flew<br /> inside  out.</p>  <p>[Poem originally appeared in <em>Pleiades</em>]</p>
