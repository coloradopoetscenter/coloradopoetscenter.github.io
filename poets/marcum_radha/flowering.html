          <h1>Flowering Tree</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Spring  went swirling over the manmade world—</p>
          <p><em>Oh blossom. Oh baby.</em></p>
          <p>Right  over a crate of dreaming trees,<br />
            iron  weathercocks, robotic wires marching across the plain.</p>
          <p><em>East, then crazy.</em></p>
          <p>Overcast  amplified green,</p>
          <p>made  citizens slowly stone-deaf to leaves,<br />
            lives  tuned to the electric sky.</p>
          <p><em>Win some.</em></p>
          <p>Charming,  the chiming mind.<br />
            If  only as charming as the fence that was sifting.</p>
          <p><em>Unknowingly.</em></p>
          <p>It  couldn&rsquo;t stop anything anyway.</p>
          <p>Not  the missile factory.<br />
            Not  the storm: first spring bolts blitzkrieging the range.</p>
          <p><em>And then some.</em></p>
          <p>Everything  far away became a flowering tree.</p>
          <p>So  we named it: The Lost City<br />
            in  Every Citizen.</p>
          <p><em>Lost from</em></p>
          <p>—petals  pressed to everything. </p>
