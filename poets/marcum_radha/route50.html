  <h1>Route 50</h1>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Like  years, the desert<br /> has  no edges—red dust, red<br /> dust  condensed, busted ash—like years,<br /> a  corrupt uniformity we cut through.</p>  <p>:</p>  <p>Where  miniature houses sail out<br /> over  shelves thrust up, where air breaks<br /> down  on rock, on conglomerate<br /> that  defines a sky.</p>  <p>:</p>  <p>Or  dream dry salt seeps<br /> from  pores in your calves.</p>  <p>:</p>  <p>In  one settlement, a headless<br /> fire  truck rusting by a shed, plastic<br /> cowboys.  In another, rancid<br /> frozen  confection.</p>  <p>:</p>  <p>One  year, the lakes were too white<br /> when  we went by.</p>  <p>:</p>  <p>Where  we go trailing<br /> our  own wake of glass, like years<br /> we  enter, enter again, stop seldom, and rest<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a><br /> in  our own dust impressions.</p>  <p>[Poem originally appeared in <em>FIELD</em>] </p>
