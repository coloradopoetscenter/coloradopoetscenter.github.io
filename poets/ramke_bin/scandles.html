<blockquote><p> not rare but a surprise, that sixth digit</p><p> or there is one finger missing, and nine</p><p> digits indicates disaster, but such </p><p> dis-aster as might engage and delight:</p><p> &ldquo;For Nine is a number very good and harmonious.</p><p> &ldquo;For Cipher is a note of augmentation very good.</p><p> &ldquo;For innumerable ciphers will amount to something.</p><p> &ldquo;For the mind of man cannot bear</p><p class="indent"> a tedious accumulation of nothings without effect.</p><p> &ldquo;For infinite upon infinite they make a chain.&rdquo; (Christopher Smart)</p>

<p>who that last morning was sitting,</p>
<p>the protrusion through the window, having</p>
<p>escaped the screen, and she (his distraught mistress)</p>
<p>was reaching through and begging him</p>
<p>to return and I being afraid I would distract</p>
<p>moved from the window and returned </p>
<p>to sleep with a vision of cat falling</p>
<p>without fear believing himself to have</p>
<p>the skill to land upon four feet</p>
<p>the art to right himself upon air</p>
<p>the right to live eight times insouciantly</p>
<p>the ability to not suffer gravity</p>
<p>but be borne on the back of all flying things of the city.</p>

<blockquote><p class="indent">PIGEON: which loves height and is not afraid</p><p>of the cat nor the foot of the passing stranger</p><p>yet does keep one eye cocked</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent">CROW: which loves height and is not afraid</p><p>of the angry man whose fist is raised against</p><p>bird and god alike, who is late even before he awakes</p><p>for his appointments and his sinful anxiety</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p class="indent"> SPARROW/PASSER: which loves the low</p><p>places around the feet of diners on the sidewalks</p><p>and is aware of her name in Latin and her place</p><p>in various scripture and delights at the trope</p><p>of god&rsquo;s eye, of being the object of God&rsquo;s attention</p><p>even though she knows better and has always known</p><p>she was less than the crumb itself swept</p><p>by the hand of the waiter from the table,</p><p>the trembling table when weather threatens.</p>

<blockquote><p>han&rsquo;gel calligraphy, developed for farmers and women,</p><p>not the elegance of Chinese used by the scholars</p><p>the story of a man who played lute and his wife</p><p>who played flute and they were attended</p><p>by flocks of phoenix birds&hellip;and after their death</p><p>simultaneous one was lifted to paradise on the back</p><p>of a dragon, and one on the back of a phoenix.</p><p>And the fiery attendants of flocks.</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>&ldquo;The bird alighted so softly it would crush nothing </p><p>would eat only dewdrops&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p> The left eye does not know what the right </p><p> eye is wanting. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p> And here is the secret of consciousness, </p><p> why mind evolved, the secret of that which </p><p> is the cause of the human, the accident </p><p> which turned us from the path </p><p> of beasts to the rising road, the Way: </p><p> the eyes are not alike but are like </p><p> a sister and brother asleep in the same house. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
