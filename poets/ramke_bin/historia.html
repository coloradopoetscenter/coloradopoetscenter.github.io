<h1>Historia Calamitatum </h1>
<p>If he needs to think he needs to think </p>
<p> of&mdash; as in, to think of the granular feel </p>
<p> of the light falling into the garden this morning, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> this a light and melodious morning, </p>
<p> but it may not be needed, nor desirable, </p>
<p> this light, this necessity, this morning. &ldquo;A world,&rdquo; </p>
<p> the boy said to himself&mdash;a kind of thinking, to say, </p>
<p> as in &ldquo;he said to himself, the world is bigger </p>
<p> than I then thought&rdquo; when the boy </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> found himself awake in the garden </p>
<p> among granular manifestations of light </p>
<p> such mornings, this morning, that last </p>
<p> morning of his past, or so he thought, </p>
<p> he who was to suffer, like the little children.</p>
