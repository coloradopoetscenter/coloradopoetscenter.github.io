<h1>Artist's Statement</h1>
<p>Born and  raised in New England,&nbsp;I majored in music at Bryn Mawr, spent several  years in New York City and at the Aspen MusicSchool studying classical  voice.&nbsp; I moved to Colorado  during the civil rights and anti-war years of the late 1960s.&nbsp; It was a  flight to&nbsp;simplicity--living weeks at a time on horseback in the  mountains, cooking over a fire, and sleeping on the ground.&nbsp; I still cook  for an outfitter, when I can.</p>
<p>I have  degrees in education and ministry from the University of Northern Colorado and the Iliff School of Theology.&nbsp;  I am a neo-Jungian&nbsp;and work with clients to support the exploration of  nooks and crannies of unconscious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Making poems is part of the  same process, for me.</p>
<p>I have  three grown children and four grands &ndash; the best in the world, of course!&nbsp;  I no longer sing professionally, but poetry has become another kind of singing,  one that challenges me to use my voice in a more essential way than performing  ever could have done.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Poems have  appeared in several literary journals, including <em>Pilgrimage, Progenitor, HeartLodge, The Sophia Journal.org, Sow&rsquo;s Ear,  Tiger&rsquo;s Eye, Voices Rising</em>, and <em>Wyoming</em><em>: the Hub of the Wheel.</em>&nbsp; </p>
