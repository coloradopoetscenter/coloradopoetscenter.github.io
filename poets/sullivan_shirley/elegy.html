<h1>Elegy for the  imagination</h1>
<p>Today I shall write a  safe poem: <br />
  no phantom buses, nor  sucker holes in deep gray clouds;&nbsp; <br />
  no witches lurking  behind the gingerbread of faith.<br />
  I will refrain from  mentioning streams that run both ways,<br />
  nor invoke gravity that  flings me into an unhinged universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  I will never again  smash the locked door to a paltry heart,<br />
  nor tell the idiot&rsquo;s  tale of even one tear;&nbsp; <br />
  not give the sea a  voice to sing of&nbsp; black wave rising,  rising, <br />
  nor ride the fragile  whispers of a dream;&nbsp; <br />
  I will not navigate by  one star a cosmos of stark, mute silence, <br />
  nor glide with the  harrier close to passion&rsquo;s rim,<br />
  nor allow the merest  whiff of joy to blow across these lines,</p>
<p class="tab">but order all things as <br />
  they must&nbsp;  be ordered <br />
  so&nbsp; that  everyone may <br />
  speak and understand <br />
  step&nbsp;  with&nbsp; confidence <br />
according to a pattern</p>
<p>today i am writing a  safe poem <br />
  predictable&nbsp;&nbsp; protected&nbsp;&nbsp;  locked&nbsp;&nbsp; sheltered&nbsp;&nbsp; secure <br />
  words&nbsp;&nbsp; lines&nbsp;&nbsp;  punctuation&nbsp;&nbsp; just so<br />
  just so </p>
