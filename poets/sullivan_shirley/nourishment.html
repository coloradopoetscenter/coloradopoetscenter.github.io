<h1>Nourishment</h1>
<p>Children of Maradi wear  red bracelets.<br />Dying, they are the  lucky ones&mdash;<br />their sisters, wrists  circled in yellow or orange bands, <br />sent home to chew  leaves tough enough <br />  to survive locusts and  drought.</p>
<p class="tab">Trinkets  tinkling, we fan ourselves <br />in  cooled houses, enfolded by lush lawns, <br />  fretful  over bruised peaches, wilted greens.</p>
<p>The mother looks at me  from the back page of the newspaper&mdash; <br />eyes slitted, brows  contracting inward, a deep gash <br />  descending her  nose.&nbsp; She does not hope.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="tab">Farmers&rsquo;  markets sport brimful baskets,<br />cascades  of crimson, gold, wine, emerald&mdash;<br />  glutted abundance.</p>
<p>The grandmother carries  her for miles, <br />fans flies from her  face, laments, It&rsquo;s the worst I&rsquo;ve seen.<br />But the world is  generous.&nbsp; Our friends hear our  cries.&nbsp; <br />  Do you think they will  let us suffer when they are living comfortably?</p>
<p class="tab">Bracelets of gold, silver, copper <br />jangle and glint in the sun&mdash;<br />  bull&rsquo;s blood offering to an indifferent god.</p>
<p><em>(Tiger&rsquo;s Eye)</em></p>
