<h1>soft and lovely</h1>
<p>the man in the purple  shirt<br />comes to me rumpled<br />and occasionally kind<br />articulate, gracious<br />my 60-expletive  deleted-<br />something older friend<br />who wears it soft and  lovely <br />and sometimes permits <br />touch though more often <br />he&rsquo;s urbane and witty<br />and so terribly precise<br />i can&rsquo;t always find <br />don quixote who never<br />wins but sends his  battered <br />heart and quiet listing  walk <br />and dark honeyed <br />voice spilling into my <br />  unexpected dreams</p>
