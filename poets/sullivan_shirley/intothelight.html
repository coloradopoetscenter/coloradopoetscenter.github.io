<h1>Into the light</h1>
<p>I want to write about  trust&mdash;<br />unconscious heart beat  or one swift smile.</p>
<p>I want to say that the  sun circles this world<br />inevitably, that light  will always shoot forth</p>
<p>sparks to silver the  wind whispering over the earth<br />from your grassy valley  to my great tree&mdash;</p>
<p>bringing your song to  me, blowing this strange<br />questioning on around  the world, scattering</p>
<p>syllables like leaves  in summer squall.&nbsp; Trust<br />is holding eyes that  deepen and fill until nothing</p>
<p>is left but light  itself.&nbsp; I want to believe<br />the stillness and the  light. </p>
<p>I want to write about  trust&mdash;not captured glow,<br />but transparent lens,  like diamonds catch-</p>
<p>ing fire and shattering  into a million<br />filaments swelling to  heal an aching world.</p>
<p>(<em>Pilgrimage)</em> </p>
