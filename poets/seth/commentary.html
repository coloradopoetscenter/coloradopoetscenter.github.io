          <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
          
          <p>&quot;One  of Denver's  more popular performance poets...original, moving and insightful&quot;<br />
          <em>&quot;Underground&quot;</em> Rocky  Mountain News (Nov 13, '94) </p>
          <p>&quot;SETH  has a leveling gaze when he speaks his poetry that harbors power and  intelligence.&quot;<br />
          <em>&quot;Reign of the Scar Clan&quot;</em> Westword (Aug  23-29, '95) </p>
          
          <p> &quot;The  plays' author SETH.....has taken two centuries of black popular music and  beautifully used it to carry the story of Moses, who leads his people to  freedom. SETH shows a natural inclination for putting together the book of a  musical; the biblical story is well-paced in distinctive segments, and the  songs illustrate emotional and narrative moments.&quot;<br />
            <em>&quot;Suite Moses&quot;</em> Rocky Mountain News (Nov 1, 2002) </p>
          
          <p> &quot;SETH  is outstanding.....The actor smoothly and movingly handles a demanding role  that requires him to transform from a young and questioning Moses, unsure that  he's the right person for the job, to an old blind man who has led his people  through the desert for 40 years.....&quot;<br />
            <em>&quot;Green Pastures&quot;</em> Denver Post  (Feb 10, '01) </p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;SETH  was A M A Z I N G! I still can&rsquo;t believe how motivated he got my students about  writing...In 15 years of teaching I have never seen so much figurative  language. Thank you SETH!!!!!)<br />

          <p>&ldquo;[SETH}  reminded me that all&nbsp;students can be writers. We need to continually teach  them to be confident about themselves and in their writing.&rdquo;<br />
