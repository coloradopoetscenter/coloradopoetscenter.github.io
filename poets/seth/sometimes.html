          <h1>Sometimes Up</h1>
          <p>Sometimes up is underground<br />
            On the subterranean verandah; new sound<br />
            Percolating new language; half mantra, half  howl<br />
            When iambic pentameter has reached its limit<br />
            And the bloody continent eclipses a spastic sky<br />
            Where the sun wears false eyelashes<br />
            And every dandelion becomes a critic<br />
            When Humpty Dumpty is tumblin' down<br />
            Sometimes up is underground</p>
          <p>So when the heart's voltage assumes fetal position<br />
            And the flies in your mustard crack a wan smile<br />
            Consult the long-haired spiders chewing cobwebs<br />
            Dance with roaches, chat with Frankenstein<br />
            Don't let that cat in your tree fade with a  frown<br />
            Get your soggy soul down under<br />
            'Cause sometimes up is underground</p>
