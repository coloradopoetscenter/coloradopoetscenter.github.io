<h1>Wind</h1>
<p>I am blowing<br />weather toward you.<br />I will change your lives<br />for better and worse.<br />We are married to <br />each other; you can-<br />not run away from<br />me. Even in death<br />your family may<br />let me scatter your<br />ashes. Accept me.<br />I will make your life<br />an amazing thing.<br />  --Michael Knisely</p>
