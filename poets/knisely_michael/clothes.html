<h1>Clothes on the Line</h1>
<p>Eve evening, Eve day, Eve<br />Wondering if Mid-Summer<br />Night&rsquo;s Eve is a good day<br />  to plant a garden &ndash; we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Clothes freshly washed, wanting<br />pins to hold them to the line<br />(or so says the speaker&rsquo;s voice),<br />&ldquo;conditions&rdquo; requiring the use of<br />a dryer, which brings along this<br />Lament for yet another moment<br />of procrastination, inertia, and<br />who am I to not find everything<br />more (or less) important, until damp<br />aromatic clothes in hand make legs<br />want to walk right out the back door<br />and drape in an unwinding path<br />Clothes on the line, from wet to dry,<br />how they hang, waft, and fly, found<br />with the smell of the sun burned into<br />  every stitch and pore.&nbsp;  Maybe next time.</p>
<p>--Michael Knisely</p>
