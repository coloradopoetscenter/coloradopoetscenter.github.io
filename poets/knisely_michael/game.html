          <h1>The Game of . . . </h1>
          <p> One  pair of hands pressed together (as in prayer)<br />
            opens  at the thumbs to accept the hands of another<br />
            pair,  whose oyster holds a button to drop inside<br />
            or  hold onto for the next, or the next, or the next,<br />
            in  the circle of the game where all are yearning<br />
            to  feel – to be the one who keeps and then releases<br />
            into  the hands of a chosen soul this secret thrill<br />
            only  those two know, until the circle is complete and<br />
            the  cry comes out, &ldquo;Button, button, who&rsquo;s got the button?&rdquo; <br />
            It&rsquo;s  all in<br />
            how  you hold<br />
            your  two hands<br />
            together<br />
            after  the<br />
            moment  of <br />
            accepting<br />
            the  button<br />
            or  nothing – <br />
            how  to keep <br />
            the  secret<br />
            between  you<br />
            long  enough<br />
            by  feigning<br />
            the  extra<br />
            heaviness<br />
            a  button<br />
            would  create<br />
            in  the eyes<br />
            of  players<br />
            desperate<br />
            to  guess right,<br />
            that  you might<br />
            win  the chance<br />
            next  time to<br />
            be  the one<br />
            holding  this<br />
            precious  pearl,<br />
            just  to feel <br />
            your  own hands<br />
            slip  inside<br />
            each  pair of<br />
            waiting  hands<br />
            encircling<br />
            yours,  hoping<br />
            to  feel you <br />
          letting  go.</p>
