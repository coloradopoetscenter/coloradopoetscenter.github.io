            <h1>The State Fair</h1>
            <p>For an hour in the late afternoon<br />
              we walk around the building at the fair<br />
              where aquariums line the outside walls,<br />
              where all the species native to Nebraska<br />
              look out and swim:&nbsp;  from the ugly gar <br />
              and paddlefish to the perch and various <br />
              bass &ndash; all the fish the young at heart<br />
          might hope to bring up from near-by lakes.</p>
            <p>This building set apart from vendors<br />
              and midway of rides we walk past <br />
              (at three dollars a throw), choosing<br />
              bumper boats to drop ourselves into,<br />
              and after the rubber life boat&rsquo;s frenzied<br />
              bump and splash, returning to the fish<br />
              tanks and the larger aquarium, where<br />
              the sixty-three pound flathead catfish<br />
              and lunker bass live, the faces of<br />
              everyone in the submerged windows<br />
              below the surface, worth the price of<br />
              admission, just to hide out here with<br />
              the fish, the water and glass holding<br />
          us apart and keeping us together.</p>
