              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <p>Michael J. Knisely  lives in Greeley, Colorado,  where he teaches writing at the University  of Northern Colorado and at Aims Community    College.&nbsp; A  recent transplant from Lincoln, Nebraska, Michael first began writing letter  poems to those he wished to woo, and. following a bachelor&rsquo;s degree at the age  of 26, took a 9-month tour of North America, keeping a journal whose last entry  is his first official &ldquo;poem,&rdquo; entitled &ldquo;Upon Receiving a Hitchhiking Ticket&rdquo;,  just outside of Indio, California, heading back to Tucson, Arizona, where he  would begin his teaching career, first teaching cooking skills to wards of the  state, then substituting in the public schools, teaching for &ldquo;real&rdquo; wages,  becoming a father (at 34), gaining an MFA in Creative Writing &ndash; Poetry from the  University of Arizona, returning to Nebraska to live and help raise his son  Noah.&nbsp; Now, one of his goals is to work  to create a Poetry Center in the Rockies (for any of you benefactors out there),  learn to appreciate fly fishing, continue to do black and white darkroom work,  and finally work to publish the books he has been procrastinating (<em>Dart Football, Noah&rsquo;s Cookbook, </em>a book  of poems, a book of photographs), and continue to teach until his time&rsquo;s  up.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>While publishing his  own poems has not been a priority for Michael, he has had poems published in an  Arizona  quarterly <em>The Prickly Pear</em>, the  monthly <em>South Ash, Inc., </em>as well as  in the online fine arts magazine <em><a href="http://www.thescreamonline.com">thescreamonline.com</a>.</em></p>
