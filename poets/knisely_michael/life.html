          <h1><em>Cervus elaphus nelsoni</em><br />
            Life (Elk Speaks)</h1>
          <p>Each baby matters, is precious,  just like any baby of<br />
            anything is, and from birth on,  every minute is something<br />
            to celebrate and too soon needing  to pay attention beyond <br />
            the milk and body heat to the  meaning of flat and steep, <br />
            sound in nose and throat to  recognize as language to know <br />
            and follow, smell to warn and  beckon, and taste in all its glory where even bark has its important cellulose  to savor (poor willow and aspen), no need to keep on guard, so few cougars, so  great the herd. Stories from the north still tell of wolves and their<br />
            peskiness, &ldquo;thinning&rdquo; (as they call  it) the least able of us, <br />
            doing the family a service (such a  &ldquo;human trait&rdquo;),<br />
            but their howls now out of earshot,  near the Wyoming border, <br />
            or so the eagle tells. Border? I  guess a fence makes sense<br />
            unless there isn&rsquo;t one, and then  it&rsquo;s up to the government<br />
            to say where our sole predator can  and cannot slay us<br />
            (and it ain&rsquo;t at Nicky&rsquo;s on Comedy  Night). The human race. <br />
            Race? What about &ldquo;Species&rdquo;? Are  there no more than Sapiens? &ldquo;Scourge&rdquo; is more like it, I suppose, but how would  I really know, I&rsquo;m only one year old!   But, to hear an old doe talk, we&rsquo;d better look for more no good to come,  even beyond all the (How many<br />
            visitors pass every year?) good  intentions to restore &ldquo;balance&rdquo;.<br />
            (Ha! Not until they can make the  rain!)   Have you ever heard <br />
            Def Leopard wailing at one of their  4th of July camping spots?<br />
            A ranger can only do so much, what  with the sweet smell of gasoline and antifreeze, and fire to chase us down the  mountain, and snow to hold us tight until the longer arcing of the sun brings  more of us along, and leaves some others of us behind. <br />
            Yes, the steady hum of spring is  worth every rising decibel,<br />
          noise a small price to pay for this  amazing place to play.</p>
