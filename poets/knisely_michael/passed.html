</ul> <h1>I Passed Laertes On My Way To The Play</h1> <p>I passed Laertes on the street as he was<br />
out walking before the play began.&nbsp; Of course<br />
he wasn&rsquo;t in costume &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t know he was<br />
Laertes then, on my own way to the play &ndash; <br />
yet his face was distinct, our glances brief<br />
but &ldquo;knowing,&rdquo; as we were each out walking<br />
to clear our heads, breathing the fresh air in, <br />
brisk (both the air and our gaits) moments <br />
before the stage and seats separated us and<br />
held us together, he performing his lines,<br />
anticipating each moment, each response<br />
to his father, his king, his sister, his friend-<br />
turned-enemy.&nbsp; Too  much his father&rsquo;s son<br />
(as Ophelia, too, had &ldquo;too much&rdquo;  Polonius in her<br />&nbsp;  to be able to rise above, too much the<br />&nbsp;  obedient even to leap from her own frying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  pan into Hamlet&rsquo;s fire). <br />
But, out walking before the curtain call, unburdened, <br />
not yet at war again with the Medieval and Modern world, <br />
jogging across the busy street, each of us brimming <br />  with the night to come, he and I did for an instant meet.</p> <p>--Michael Knisely</p>
