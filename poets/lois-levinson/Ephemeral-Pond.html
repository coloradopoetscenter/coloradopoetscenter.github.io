<h1>Ephemeral Pond</h1><p>A poem is taking shape in my  brain <br />  like an ephemeral pond after  a storm,<br />  an entire ecosystem that  unfolds<br />  in a place I thought was dry  land. </p><p>Only yesterday I made my way  through <br />  withered grasses, suffered  those desiccated <br />  seeds with prickly edges that  stick <br />  to your shoes and poke  through your socks.</p><p>Today in that very spot a  pond emerges:<br />  blue-winged teal and mallards  dabble <br />  in its waters, and snowy  egrets <br />  on black stilts step high at  its shoreline. </p><p>Now a great blue heron glides  in<br />  to the water&rsquo;s edge, folds  its impressive <br />  wingspan and waits for the  fish. <br />  Can there be fish in an  ephemeral pond? </p><p>Marsh grasses and reeds  sprout up,Â  <br />  and frogs croak in the  cattails. <br />  Above the playa, dragonflies  take flight,<br />  and violet green swallows  swoop and dive<br />  <br />  for insects on the wing.  Red-winged blackbirds<br />  perch on reeds and croon  their <em>po-poreeee</em>.<br />  Unseen in the greenery, a  tiny common <br />  yellowthroat belts out his <em>witchety, witchety</em> aria.</p><p>I throw off my shoes and  socks, <br />  plunge my feet into the  nascent water, <br />  inhale its earthy scent,  reach in to pluck <br />  waterborne leaves and feel  their slimy skins.</p><p>I must write the poem before  it all vanishes.  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First published in <em>Bird's Thumb</em></p><p>Appearing in <em>Before It All Vanishes</em> and <em>Crane Dance</em></p>
