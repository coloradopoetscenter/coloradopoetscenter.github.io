        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Lois Levinson's  poetry engages the reader in the fullness of a fleeting moment.Â  She seeks the extraordinary in the everyday,  finds clarity in fog, ponders life's fragility and takes us to the threshold of  that elusive passage into another world. She is the author  of <em>Before It All Vanishes</em>, (Finishing  Line Press, 2018), as well as a  chapbook, <em>Crane Dance</em> (Finishing Line  Press, 2017). </p>
        <p>Lois is a graduate  of the Poetry Book Project at Denver's Lighthouse Writers Workshop. Her poems  have appeared in <em>Bird&rsquo;s Thumb, Clementine  Poetry Journal, The Corner Club Press, These Fragile Lilacs, Mountain Gazette,  The Literary Nest, Gravel, Literary Mama, Yew Journal and Mount Hope. </em>She  continues to meet regularly to share poetry and literary encouragement with the <em>Wyrd Sisters, </em>her poetic cohort from  the Poetry Book Project. </p>
