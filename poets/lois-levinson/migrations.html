<h1>Migrations</h1><p>Birding along the border in the shadow of  Tijuana,<br />  eyes alert for the rufous-crowned sparrow,<br />  I begin to read another story inscribed in the trail.<br />  A blue shirt, part of a shoe, flattened water bottles,<br />  a bicycle frame without wheels<br />  abandoned in the dash for cover,<br />  dropped while dodging the searchlights.<br /><br />  Unbidden, an image surfaces of another time<br />  and other border crossings made at night and on foot.<br />  My father, a little boy, riding atop the bundles<br />  in a wooden cart pushed by his brothers<br />  over broken roads, his mother and sisters<br />  plodding behind, their shoes wearing thin.<br />  Cold clawing through coats and blankets.<br />  Fleeing pogroms. Walking across Poland<br />  all the way to the sea.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First published in <em>Bird's  Thumb</em><br />  Appearing in <em>Before It All  Vanishes</em></p>
