        <h1>Migrations</h1>
        <p>Birding along the border in the shadow of  Tijuana,<br />
          eyes alert for the rufous-crowned sparrow,<br />
          I begin to read another story inscribed in the trail.<br />
          A blue shirt, part of a shoe, flattened water bottles,<br />
          a bicycle frame without wheels<br />
          abandoned in the dash for cover,<br />
          dropped while dodging the searchlights.<br />
  <br />
          Unbidden, an image surfaces of another time<br />
          and other border crossings made at night and on foot.<br />
          My father, a little boy, riding atop the bundles<br />
          in a wooden cart pushed by his brothers<br />
          over broken roads, his mother and sisters<br />
          plodding behind, their shoes wearing thin.<br />
          Cold clawing through coats and blankets.<br />
          Fleeing pogroms. Walking across Poland<br />
          all the way to the sea.<br />
