<h1>Cancer Pavilion</h1><p>I enter the  building  <br />  marked  &quot;Cancer Pavilion&quot; <br />  in ten-foot  high letters,<br />  as if to  confront <br />  the  disease, <br />  stare it  down, <br />  manage the  fear.<br />  In the  lobby I pass <br />  spectral  patients <br />  in  treatment, <br />  the  unnaturally thin, <br />  the  hairless. I want <br />  to explain  myself: <br /><em>Excuse me,</em><br /><em>I'll just be a minute.</em><br /><em>I really don't belong here  – </em><br /><em>I'm cured, you see; </em><br /><em>just here for a follow-up, </em><br /><em>not for surgery </em><br /><em>or radiation or chemo,</em><br /><em>like you.</em>  <br />  I feel  myself stepping <br />  too heavily  through <br />  the lobby, <br />  taking up  too much <br />  space in  the elevator,<br />  my  conspicuous health <br />  giving  offense <br />  to the  others <br />  in the  oncologist's <br />  waiting  room.<br />  I am not  one of them:<br />  my color is  too good,<br />  my hair too  firmly attached,<br />  my posture  too straight, <br />  while they endure <br />  the  interminable waiting <br />  sunken in  their chairs,<br />  eyes fixed  on something<br />  I cannot  see. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Appearing in <em>Before It All Vanishes</em>  </p>
