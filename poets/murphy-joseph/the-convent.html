        <h1>The Convent</h1>
        <p><em>For Victor de Perez</em></p>
        <p>A bed for them had been a narrow plank: for a pillow, <br />
          A piece of wood we&rsquo;d stack by a fireplace. </p>
        <p>I hoped the reward for such contrition had been  sublime.</p>
        <p>Their mummified remains stood in open coffins<br />
          Leaned against a cellar wall. Dressed in coarse  habits, <br />
          They had likely sewn, eternity for these nuns <br />
          Included being displayed<br />
          To disbelievers. </p>
        <p>We passed through quickly, in silence:<br />
          Better to endure insult or loss<br />
          Than hard truth at an arm&rsquo;s length; <br />
          Better, still, to stride a broad Mexico City street.</p>
        <p>What a fine noise <br />
          Rose from that bar we found,<br />
          Where workdays ended; what a delight<br />
          To laugh in that crowded, <br />
          Smoky room. </p>
