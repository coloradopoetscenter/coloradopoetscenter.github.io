<h1>After a Fire at a Jewelry Store</h1><p>That he had gone unnoticed seemed miraculous. </p><p>How much longer<br />  Could he poke among the ashes? </p><p>Where was that dream-sized jewel? His share. <br />  Was it to remain imagined? One more hope<br />  Soon to burst, its shards<br />  Hollow as moonlight? </p><p>For that soot-covered man, better the hunt<br />  Than to sit by the fountain and lunch; <br />  Better to risk arrest <br />  Than to lack. </p><p>Better yet, and easier, by night <br />  To scoop coins from a fountain, <br />  Taking what others had wished away.</p><p>But this was a singular chance.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t we each harbor that greater end: a find<br />  That can transform us? </p><p>So, more power to him! Let him pocket<br />  His life-changing prize. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Â© Joseph Murphy 2017<br />  Originally appeared in <em>Loch Raven Review</em></p>
