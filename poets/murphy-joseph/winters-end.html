        <h1>Winter&rsquo;s End</h1>
        <p>In that spring&rsquo;s first true  gleam,<br />
          Lightening creased the walls<br />
          And thunder gathered the  rarest of fragrances<br />
          Into its mouth.</p>
        <p>The water from my tipped bowl <br />
          Spilled down a mountain the  height of a weed; the breeze<br />
          Read aloud evening&rsquo;s first  page. </p>
        <p>It was then that rain rose  from the soil <br />
          And a star descended <br />
          Through the roots of these  words.</p>
        <p>The evening became brighter,  quieter: <br />
          No minute hand&rsquo;s clatter  broke through<br />
          No wheel skidded past.</p>
        <p>Time became nothing more or  less than time.</p>
        <p>I cast my lines ashore: sang  as prow and sail burned, <br />
          Knowing my wounds would heal. </p>
        <p>Thoughts that had been  tightly woven spun loose. </p>
        <p>That evening&rsquo;s warmth  lingered on my bare shoulders; <br />
          The scent of damp loam  sweetened the air. </p>
        <p>In that enormous space, <br />
          Our past seemed no more than  a whisper<br />
          Sensed at the edge of sleep.</p>
