        <h1>The Shape of New Words</h1>
        <p>Something new rises as the first rains enrich the  soil: </p>
        <p>Words, believed lost, well up<br />
          Past freshly shaped leaves;</p>
        <p>Missing verse ascends through the flowering brush. </p>
        <p>What was unfinished is ended; secrets<br />
          Curl from the sky&rsquo;s cuff, <br />
          Forming a lyric<br />
          Sung by weed and stone.</p>
        <p>Lost languages burst from a crisscross of roots; <br />
          Rising through the rain&rsquo;s nib,<br />
          To be written on breeze and bark.</p>
        <p>Voices that leap from a sea cliff&rsquo;s clay<br />
          Enter our throats,<br />
          And we begin to track <br />
          The orbit of their sounds. </p>
        <p>Forgotten pages appear in our hands. </p>
        <p>We begin to whisper rhymes<br />
          Written by the dew; by salt spray<br />
          Billowing from bees&rsquo; wings; by a gleam<br />
          Reflected on a polished cup. </p>
        <p>Our mouths can now shape the newest of words. </p>
        <p>We need no longer pry them<br />
          From the fray of regretted lives; heal<br />
          Their scorched hands; shelter them<br />
          In the well of our mingled blood.</p>
