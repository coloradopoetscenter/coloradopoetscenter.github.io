          <h1>The Half-Life of Plastic </h1>
          <p><em>                        We have slept with death  all our lives.</em><br />
            <em>                        It will grind out its  graceless victory.</em><br />
            <br />
            —Jack Gilbert </p>
          <p>While new  planets are growing <br />
          old stars are  dying </p>
          <p>and I’m  listening to heartbeats <br />
            that want the  half-life of plastic</p>
          <p>Before I am  reconceived<br />
            I want to cradle  warm smiles</p>
          <p>I want to see  how heavy <br />
            the edge of  heaven is</p>
          <p>But gravity is  dry heaving in a coffin of sky <br />
            and scientists  watch with robotic gasps</p>
          <p>This is not a  formula    <br />
            I am not a flame  screaming <em>burn</em></p>
          <p>The air is full  of chemicals<br />
            I am full of  chemicals</p>
          <p>and I will be  failed by membranes and rhetoric <br />
            fighting test  tubes and stanzas</p>
          <p>as I wait to  walk into shadows<br />
            I wait to be  inside things I’ll never know          </p>
