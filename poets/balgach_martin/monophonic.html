<h1>My Monophonic Heart</h1>  <p>My monophonic  heart<br /> measures the  weight of butterflies<br /> with a beat. My  monophonic heart <br /> is as true as an  out-of-tune fiddle. <br /> It sings the  tired tune of solitude <br /> like an old  rooster <br /> on a rainy  morning<br /> in the middle of  nowhere. <br /> My monophonic  heart<br /> is waiting for  tomorrow <br /> as if tomorrow  is a train<br /> that will never  come.<br /> My monophonic  heart <br /> is an icicle  without snow.<br /> It’s a bud in  spring <br /> that doesn’t  know<br /> how to become a  leaf.<br /> My monophonic  heart<br /> is a bored child  with thick glasses<br /> picking his nose  for hours<br /> and sometimes my  monophonic heart<br /> tries to define  itself<br /> like a dog  choking himself on a leash. <br /> But really<br /> my monophonic  heart<br /> is a scratched  record skipping a beat—<br /> it’s a dusty  needle <br /> filling in the  grooves <br />  with all this  new noise. </p>  <p>Originally  appeared in<em> The Bitter Oleander</em></p>
