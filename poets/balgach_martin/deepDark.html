 </div>  <h1>The  Deep Dark </h1>  <p>Someone told me  there are more connections in the human brain <br /> than stars in  the known universe. But a synapse<br /> wants me to  disagree. How many stars are there <br /> anyway. How many  stories are hiding <br /> in the jowls of  our dead. The afternoon <br /> is a fist  punching my heart. Tonight, I’ll eat my breaths for supper.  <br /> There is a  tunnel of emptiness ahead and behind us. Pessoa said <br /> it’s the dead  that are born, that we’re sleeping, that life is the dream. I’m saying <br /> I don’t want to  be part of forever. Eternal recurrence <br /> is an apple  forged into a scalpel and I don’t want any more tall tales.  <br /> All six billion  of us are drunk on hearsay. Time <br /> is a long  strange finger pointing to the moon. I mean<br /> my grandfather  is 93. Each day and every night <br /> he sits in a  brown chair, with a blanket if it’s winter,<br /> watching TV and  eating with his false teeth that click and grind over<br /> whatever he  tries to swallow. Sometimes he calls me just to say hello<br /> and I don’t  always answer the phone. He is more alone <br /> than anyone. How  many more suppers <br /> are waiting on  white plastic trays. How many televisions <br /> are holding the  hands of our lonely. How many million hands.How many million stars don’t we know.If every connection in our brains <br /> were equal to a  breath, how far would that be.  <br />  I’m tired of the  facts. I’ve been believing for a lifetime. </p>  <p>Originally  appeared in<em> Poetry Miscellany</em></p>
