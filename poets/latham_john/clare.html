              <h1>Clare
              </h1>
              <p>She has no name, she is a million<br />
                years old, and the gin inside her <br />
                has turned spiteful. She&rsquo;s lost <br />
the man who bought her <br />
but has not yet paid,<br />
she&rsquo;s lost the key to the house <br />
she can't remember<br />
except for rapping on the panes.<br />
People skirt her, flopped <br />
against stone steps, eyes closed <br />
stretching for some song.<br />
<br />
Damp rises through her buttocks<br />
swarms along her spine <br />
earth and sky meld into one <br />
and she, so often alien<br />
only eighty percent water<br />
dissolves into the air. Sluiced,<br />
she swirls inside the shape of her.<br />
She&rsquo;s Clare. She's four years old<br />
the wallpaper is warm.<br />
Berries on the rowan tree <br />
outside her bedroom window, jig.</p>
