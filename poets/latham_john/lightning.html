<h1><strong>From Professor Nobu Kitagawa&rsquo;s Notebooks</strong> <strong>On Effects of Lightning on the Human Body</strong></h1>
<p><strong></strong><strong><em>(Tr.from the Japanese by N.  Kitagawa)</em></strong></p>
<p><em>89. Incident  on the Horikiko Coast (30/07/78)</em><br />Young couple  alone, he recumbent on red rock<br />near pinnacle of  sand-hill pocketed with grass,<br />she by his feet,  sky making threat of raindrops<br />though earth  remaindered dry. Mid-afternoon,<br />adjacent to  sun&rsquo;s zenith, she touching ground<br />at plural  potions of her body, while lightning<br />conflaged  cracked dead-bush 6m from stone,<br />surge entering  body by left toe and knee-skins<br />scorched but  hardly. Consciousness abandoned<br />but resumed  itself to her beyond thirty minutes<br />bequeathing no  damage but burn marks, livid<br />at spine  terminus, shaping like shouting throat.<br />Her memories of  suction into light fibrillating<br />like new leaves.  Man felt no perverse effects,<br />seven  heart-flowers uncorrupted in his hand,<br />  though since he  suffers rapture of tympanum.</p>
<p><em>213.  Higashi-Yuri-Machi Incident (22/09/97)</em><br />In Takaiwa-Yama,  summer&rsquo;s declining parts,<br />school-teacher  of language and nine-year son<br />relaxing in  garden by lotus pool at light-fade,<br />playing go. No  hailstones, no St. Elmo&rsquo;s fire,<br />so foreboding  invalid, yet flash strick jay-tree<br />20m distance,  beneath whose roots iron pipe<br />reclined,  convoying pool-water at arid times.<br />Predominant  currents swept below go-board<br />and players  either side, with subsidiary flow<br />up left leg of  father, departing from his body<br />at index,  central fingers of right hand almost <br />touching board.  They badly cindered, fused,<br />yet still  holding black stone for further play.<br /><em>There is  death in the ha-ne</em>, as proverb says.<br />Boy hurtled into  water, naked as carried out,<br />  unscathed except  for fern-prints on left heel.</p>
