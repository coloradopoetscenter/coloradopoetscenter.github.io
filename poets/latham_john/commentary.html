<p align="left"><strong>Some Reviews of UK Poetry Collections</strong></p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Whether writing from the child&rsquo;s-eye view or the man&rsquo;s, John Latham emerges from this sad, funny, tender book as a poet who sees truths from a strikingly original angle of vision.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jeremy Hooker, <em>Anglo-Welsh Review</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Spectacular writing, with lines that hang around in the mind long after you&rsquo;ve read them.&rdquo; &nbsp;Ian McMillan, <em>Iron</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His verse is almost all passionate recall of childhood and marriage, a poetry of sensitivity such as many novels offer. The detail is exact, the spirit of the past is conjured through the words most feelingly.&rdquo; &nbsp;Peter Porter, <em>Observer</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poetic effects are subtle &hellip;.. yet he is able to make the tiniest details sing. Unsentimental, plain, but rhythmically invigorating.&rdquo; &nbsp;John Greening, <em>Poetry Review</em></p>
