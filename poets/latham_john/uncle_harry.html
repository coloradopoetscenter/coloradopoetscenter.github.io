(Cheshire, July 21, 1937)
</p>
<p>  I've always respected scholarship, new ideas,<br />and I've read about your work<br />in the <em>Sunday Empire News</em> - that relativity.<br />And you're right, things do look different<br />from each side of a fence, each end of a bottle, too.<br />But you've got it wrong about the clocks.</p>
<p>Think about it, Albert. I go off on a space-ship,<br />come back a few weeks younger than my twin.<br />That's OK, I suppose, <br />no repercussions worth bothering about<br />but what if my Dad went, on a longer journey<br />and came back a child <br />a little boy a lot younger than me?<br />Well, my Mum would be confused,<br />she'd tuck him up at night, in his crib, I mean my crib, <br />and go off to bed with me. Wouldn't she? <br />That would be incest, Dr Einstein.</p>
<p>Are you an atheist? Don't bother to reply.<br />I see it now, a German plot.<br />That's why your books aren't published<br />in the Fatherland, only over here<br />so we'll read that nonsense about clocks,<br />people will believe it because your hair is white<br />and the papers say you're wise</p>
<p>and soon, all the men in England <br />will be sleeping with their mothers<br />millions of babies will be born insane<br />our Empire will crumble. Kraut!</p>
<p>I've been a painter and decorator all my life,<br />I see the whole world from my ladder<br />I can spot a fraud a mile away.<br />Don't provoke me, Einstein.<br />If I were you, I'd get off the train at Crewe.</p>
