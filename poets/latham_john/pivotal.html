<h1>Pivotal
</h1>
<p>The first one shocks them both<br /><br />as if a lightning stroke<br />somewhere down the line<br />
has galvanised his strings,<br />
he can't help the leaping fist<br />
the thud, knees slow buckling<br />
tooth sliding down her chin<br />
onto the floor.<br />
<br />
The second poised, provisional,<br />
the two of them alone<br />
in a room without a door,<br />
he torn between his impulses<br />
to cradle her bruised face<br />
or to purple lips<br />
he can no longer read.<br />
<br />
Which route he won't decide<br />
until he's looked into her eyes,<br />
discovered if the pain he sees<br />
- fear, contempt <br />
or intolerably, love -<br />
makes his knuckles tighten,<br />
start to itch.<br />
<br />
Beyond the second, it is simple.</p>
