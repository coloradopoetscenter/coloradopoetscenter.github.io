              <p><em>Hey Yeller</em>! <em>Catch</em>! They'd flick us packs of gum<br />
                as we raced along the towpath of the Ship Canal<br />
and those noisy crew-cut men with nasal accents<br />
glided past. Threw me some too, but not so often,<br />
and though I savoured this new taste, chewed on<br />
beyond its sourness until it wouldn't stretch,<br />
I thought it might be disloyal to wave back.<br />
Hitler was easy, he was wicked, Goebbels, too, <br />
Himmler, Goering, throat-hurting names to say,<br />
but these Yanks from unlikely sounding places<br />
- Alabama, Chatanooga, Tallahassee, Tennessee -<br />
they were on our side Dad said. Yet Mr Lawless<br />
declared you couldn't trust them, as the blade<br />
of his bacon-slicer inched towards the pinkness<br />
of his palm, and all the women shook their heads<br />
and nodded, except for Mrs Preece, who dropped<br />
her coupon book, stumbled out into the street,<br />
Mrs Job thanked God the stench had gone away,<br />
Mrs Bickerstaff said it was not for us to judge<br />
especially if our men were missing presumed dead<br />
and Mrs Job snapped back that if they were ready <br />
to be blown to bits for us, the least we could do<br />
was keep our ankles closed, and Mr Lawless said<br />
<em>Now ladies</em>, my mother frowned and whispered<br />
I mustn't listen to grown-up talk, and Yeller's<br />
mother was frowning at her too, and we looked <br />
at each other from our secret playground below<br />
shopping-basket height, that was the first time<br />
she ever smiled at me, ever noticed me, though<br />
I could remember the day she started school,<br />
she was three, straw-haired and pencil-legged,<br />
clutching a bottle stained with currant juice,<br />
her weekly allocation from the Food Office, <br />
and sunlight on her pigtails made me swallow.<br />
That was sixty years ago. She's not skinny now,<br />
it's not fruit-juice in the bottle always hidden <br />
in her coat, our child-filled years together<br />
have long since ebbed away, but if we meet<br />
she still flashes me the same complicit smile,<br />
and her hair, for that moment, glistens yellow.</p>
