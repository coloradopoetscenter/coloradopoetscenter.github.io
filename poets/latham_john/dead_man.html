              <h1>Dead Man, One Year On</h1>
              <p>My scattered specks are in St Vitus dance. <br />
              You must be calling me.</p>
              <p>But I'm disassembled. No me, only my want.<br />
                Not yet thin enough to sleep.<br />
  No sleep since the day I didn't wake.</p>
              <p><em>Where are my football boots?</em></p>
              <p>Here is not a place, I am not here,<br />
                no seasons, no colour <br />
          no time where pulses do not beat.</p>
              <p>All is slow dispersal, rising entropy.</p>
              <p>I can no longer differentiate you<br />
                lover, mother, son. Only the baby<br />
  whose name is lost to me<br />
  has its own shape. <br />
  Are you suckling still? Are you a boy?</p>
              <p><em>Two fish please, with vinegar.</em></p>
              <p>Next year you'll all be nothing<br />
                but shadows in deep fog,<br />
                your calling weaker<br />
  my dust more thinly spread<br />
  and I - not I - <br />
  won't fidget in my sleep.</p>
              <p><em>Where are my feet?</em></p>
