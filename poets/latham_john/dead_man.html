<h1>Dead Man, One Year On</h1>
<p>My scattered specks are in St Vitus dance. <br />
You must be calling me.</p>
<p>But I'm disassembled. No me, only my want.<br />Not yet thin enough to sleep.<br />No sleep since the day I didn't wake.</p>
<p><em>Where are my football boots?</em></p>
<p>Here is not a place, I am not here,<br />no seasons, no colour <br />  no time where pulses do not beat.</p>
<p>All is slow dispersal, rising entropy.</p>
<p>I can no longer differentiate you<br />lover, mother, son. Only the baby<br />whose name is lost to me<br />has its own shape. <br />Are you suckling still? Are you a boy?</p>
<p><em>Two fish please, with vinegar.</em></p>
<p>Next year you'll all be nothing<br />but shadows in deep fog,<br />your calling weaker<br />my dust more thinly spread<br />and I - not I - <br />won't fidget in my sleep.</p>
<p><em>Where are my feet?</em></p>
