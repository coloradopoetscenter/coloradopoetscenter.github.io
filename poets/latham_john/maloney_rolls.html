  <h1>Maloney Rolls a Yellow Stone Away
</h1>
<p>I've been invested this wild night with the power <br />of life and death over Peter Huxtable<br />whom I've not seen for fifty years, and sits now<br />in mottoed blazer, fresh-faced on the front row<br />at the AGU Symposium on Global Warming<br />where a hyphenated man is shortly to present<br />a plagiarised version of my ideas for its control </p>
<p>and lurching from my bed I turn my buttocks <br />to the mirror, look diagonally up<br />between my puzzled thighs<br />as pursed skin parts, blurts out a trumpet call<br />sweet as at Tutenkamen's tomb</p>
<p>the resurrection not of Pharoah <br />but the Peter I once knew, and never knew<br />- old before his time, even as a baby,<br />dead man who's not yet learned to shave.</p>
<p>My radio spurts out two words - <em>religious sex</em> &ndash; <br />and I don't care if it's profane<br />as long as it's with Alice<br />whom I've known since long before I met her<br />but yesterday I did not recognise</p>
<p>who's not at the symposium on global warming<br />who once massaged the length of me<br />with olive oil, knelt <br />but we were laughing so much we couldn't do it<br />we slithered round the point<br />like Peter Huxtable - despite his seat on the front row.</p>
