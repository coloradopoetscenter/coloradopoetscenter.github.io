              <h1>AM I TOO BROWN?</h1>
              <p><strong>A dedication to  Civianna Gallegos</strong></p>
              <p>Grandma, Am I too brown? <br />
                A little <em>Navajo  chicanita</em> asked<br />
                sporting a contorted smile<br />
                her beautiful brown oval eyes<br />
                squinting in confusion<br />
                her face grimacing <br />
                lost in a delusion.<br />
                Grandma, should I hide behind a cloud?<br />
                or wear a white shroud<br />
                when the sun comes out?&nbsp; <br />
                No, my child, <br />
                You can never be too brown.&nbsp;  You are<br />
                God&rsquo;s beautiful creation.<br />
                You are a bronze sculpture <br />
                a radiant flower <br />
                growing <em>en un jardin  de</em> <em>la raza cosmica</em>.<br />
  <em>Sus raices</em> are  tied<br />
                to <em>la tierra de su madre.</em><br />
  <em>Mi&rsquo;ja</em> color brown is  part of<em> el</em> <em>arco iris</em>,<br />
                closer to <em>hermano sol.</em><br />
                You are the Fall<br />
                calling the snow to come down and visit.<br />
                You are as beautiful as the brown leaves<br />
                falling from the trees as summer ends.<br />
                You are the dusk giving permission<br />
                for the sun to go to sleep<br />
                watching springtime rain drops<br />
                fall silently during times of darkness<br />
                grieving intolerance<br />
                brought about by ignorance. <br />
                You will never be too brown.<br />
                You are part of a grand cosmology<br />
                a picture of innocence<br />
                now tainted with<em> prejucio.</em><br />
  <em>No mi&rsquo;ja</em> you can  never be too brown.</p>
