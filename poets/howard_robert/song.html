      <h1>Song of the Rockies</h1>
      <p>The Rockies sing to us at sunrise <br />
        when crystal snow-capped peaks<br />
        chant iridescent matins to the dawn,<br />
        the dawn of a fresh new mountain day. </p>
      <p>Luminous pastel clouds <br />
        hover across the horizon<br />
        painting the hills and valleys below<br />
        in mysterial shades of<br />
        lavender, amber and rose.</p>
      <p>The Rockies sing to us at daybreak<br />
        when every crest and vale<br />
        unites in raising anthems to the dawn,<br />
        The dawn of a bright new mountain morn.</p>
      <p>Forests and fields awaken.<br />
        A bull elk grazes by an alpine lake.<br />
        An eagle soars through the morning mist<br />
        over rainbows of mountain paintbrush.<br />
        A hilltop lake spills over its rim <br />
        and cascades down the slope<br />
        etching serpentine streams in the valley below.</p>
      <p>We can hear the mountains singing.<br />
        In every creature, ridge and flower<br />
        They bring to us their jubilant songs<br />
        of wilderness, wildlife and wonder .</p>
      <p>We can hear the Rockies singing.<br />
        The mountains sing forever!</p>
      <p>(from Wilderness Reflections)<br />
