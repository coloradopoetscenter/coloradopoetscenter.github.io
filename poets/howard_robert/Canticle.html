<h1>Canticle of Hope </h1><p>The whole earth resounds <br />  with the exuberant songs <br />of nature&rsquo;s majestic harmony. </p><p>And sways to the steady pulse <br />  of all that breathes and roams the land, <br />  that inhabits the rushing brooks <br />  or soars through borderless skies, <br />  of every seedling, flower and chrysalis. <br />  And every newborn calf and golden field. <br />  all that rise to greet the sun <br />  intone their festal hymns <br />  to nature&rsquo;s exultant harmony. </p><p>The boundless wonders of nature&rsquo;s realm, <br />  sustain our spirits and illumine our paths <br />  with wisdom taught by the lakes and mountains <br />  and solace sung by the forests and plains. <br />  So with steady and transfigured hearts, <br />  we forge our trails through hallowed land. </p><p>When the sun has run its daily course <br />  and when twilight claims the fading light, <br />  we offer thanks for the nascent moon <br />  and the radiant star-jeweled night - <br />  tuning our faith and aspirations <br />  to the music of the spheres. </p><p>The whole earth resounds <br />  with the exuberant songs <br />  of nature&rsquo;s majestic harmony </p><p>(from <em>Wilderness  Reflections)</em></p>
