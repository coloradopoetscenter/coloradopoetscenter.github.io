            <h1>Sipapu</h1>
              <p>At the third world's first sun, <br />
                the Anasazi climbed <br />
                through a narrow Sipapu <br />
                and pressed footprints in the dust <br />
                of a new unspoiled universe. </p>
              <p>In secluded canyon hollow <br />
                watered by softly chanting springs, <br />
                they piled rocks upon stones <br />
                shaping vast adobe cities <br />
                mortared with pastes of moistened clay. </p>
              <p>At Mesa Verde - Chaco - de Chelly <br />
                fields of maize sway, <br />
                brushed by the canyon winds <br />
                while Pueblos danced in the plazas below <br />
                to the throbbing beats <br />
                of skin-stretched hollow log drums. </p>
              <p>Today their children&rsquo;s children <br />
                circle fire pits in sacred Kivas <br />
                raising chants and prayers <br />
                to their hallowed ancestors. </p>
              <p>Wearied by famine and conquest, <br />
                Pueblo eyes scan the heavens <br />
                searching for a new Sipapu <br />
                to lead them to a better world still. <br />
