 </div><h1>Commentary</h1><p>&quot;Indeed, I was at  the&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;performance and very much enjoyed &quot;Wilderness  Reflections&quot;. &nbsp;Both the beginning and ending, written by you,  captured the essence of Rocky Mountain National Park. &nbsp; The poetry of  Wendell Berry was an added treat. &nbsp; During the performance, I found myself  thinking 'what a fitting tribute to those who had the foresight 100 years ago  to set this place aside so that future generations could celebrate.' &nbsp; May  the Rockies sing forever! Thanks to you and the OSEP for this  wonderful tribute to the park on the occasion of its 100th anniversary&quot;. </p><p>Vaughn Baker, Supervisor, Rocky  Mountain National Park.&nbsp;</p>
