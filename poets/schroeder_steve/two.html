<h1> Two Minutes at the Dillingham Airport </h1>

<p> The sun afloat in a deep river </p>
<p> blue as the Kanektok must be&mdash; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Tinged with the tang of salmon, </p>
<p> airflows tickle tame noses&mdash; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> A Grumman Goose pointing </p>
<p> down the gravel taxi strip, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> A great groaning waterfowl </p>
<p> to carry the few intrepid souls&mdash; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Toward the leisurely reel of skyline, </p>
<p> where mountains and forests surely </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Open apertures, eyes, and horizons, </p>
<p> a husky/wolf hybrid pulls its owner. </p>

<p><em> &nbsp;</em>The sun afloat still where it was, </p>
<p> anchored in current overhead&mdash; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> A bush plane buzzing and biting, </p>
<p> a horsefly in the feathers&mdash; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Concrete on terminal walls </p>
<p> grayer than the Kanektok </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Flashes unlike the sides of coho salmon </p>
<p> landed thrashing on a hook&mdash; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Outside the only gate an Inuit drinks </p>
<p> from a paper bag and watches </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Arrivals and departures not seeing </p>
<p> each other for even a minute. </p>
