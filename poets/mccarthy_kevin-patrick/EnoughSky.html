            <h1>Enough Sky</h1>
              <p>(Commended by The UK Poetry Society)</p>
              <p>Not getting enough sky now that<br />
                it&rsquo;s pindrop dusk and Venus<br />
                flirts with a slabby moon<br />
                       <br />
                Spalls of silver flush livid –<br />
                I cannot flank desire<br />
                and all this reaching<br />
                               <br />
                for what must be, this needing<br />
                to cultivate the verge,<br />
                always it must be<br />
                       <br />
                as lewd as breathing, must be<br />
                looking for this and finding that<br />
                shadow, you must be<br />
                       <br />
                not getting enough light for<br />
                jade pockets of faith,<br />
                volunteers for tenderness<br />
                     <br />
                closeted to compensate<br />
                the urge; so still I<br />
                saw you kneeling<br />
                           <br />
                for poppies that burst<br />
                though the sidewalk, urging<br />
                tangerine starward,<br />
                     <br />
                pausing as we do in<br />
                vesper half–light, waiting<br />
                for more, knowing<br />
                    <br />
                only else, abiding shyly to<br />
                be known and not heard, still<br />
                ever and not ever<br />
                       <br />
                brawling as we do<br />
                in trajectory, arcing<br />
                for the cobalt edge<br />
                         <br />
                Not getting enough mauve, you<br />
                there by the view, seeking<br />
                gauze to pull away, find<br />
                       <br />
                only me watching, warmly<br />
                embracing else, when<br />
                it is enough sky<br />
                     <br />
                just then, enough answering<br />
                glances in deep focus<br />
                for mortal weather</p>
