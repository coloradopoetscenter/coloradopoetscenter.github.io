 <h1>Write a Fountain</h1>
<p>(<em>Common Ground</em>, Spring/Summer 2014)<br /> <br />You can't resign with<br />that fountain pen lying<br />there prettily translucent,<br />forest green, because I am<br />that pen – I am every pen –<br />I am waiting<br /><br />Go home, make tea, think<br />about pens, emblems, the<br />creaking table where we<br />scrawled morning devotions<br />in parcels of light<br />  <br />The escapes we contrived,<br />the blue bread truck you<br />said would be necessary,<br />the groaning furniture<br />left for pilgrims<br /> <br />Get out the nibs, smell<br />the tart ink danger, see<br />the sure jotting, the<br />cocked confessions, the<br />letters looping boldly<br /> <br />Extract plans from<br />glinting instruments,<br />read signs through sticky<br />context, marshal exploits<br />on opining mahogany<br />  <br />Write out what you are<br />to me – a book, a shoe, a<br />puzzle, anything – and say<br />with lashes of danger ink<br />why I can't resign</p>
