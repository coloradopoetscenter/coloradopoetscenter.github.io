              <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
              <p>&ldquo;From the start, 'Enough Sky' impresses with its tight lyricism and careful adjectives. It is delightfully elusive and warrants repeated reading. A poem which crept up on me and won me over with its spell and its surprising phrases - 'urging tangerine starward', 'seeking gauze to pull away'. This is a poem which feels longer than it is because it packs in a lot - lush and distilled.'' - Roddy Lumsden, poetry judge for The Poetry Society (UK).</p>
