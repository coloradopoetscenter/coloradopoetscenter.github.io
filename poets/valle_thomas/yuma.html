<h1>Yuma
</h1>
<p>Large field of corn<br />Surround the small town<br />The smell of a cattle feed <br /><br />The smell of the pig farms<br /><br />Hi way 34 runs through <br /><br />Train tracks and dogs<br />Howling to the sound of<br /><br />  Shaking in the local trailer</p>
<p> Main Street full of kids </p>
<p> Country town, life </p>
<p> Pick up full of farm boys or<br />  <br />Left off at the local <br /><br />To spend the hard earned <br /><br />From days of toil in <br /><br />Sending money back to their<br />Wives and kids in Mexico<br /><br />Well somewhere one hundred <br /><br />Fifty miles away Denver<br />  Rich fat cats eat steak, and</p>
<p> Welcome to the American <br />  <br />  Pedro, Jose, Maria, Billy </p>
<p> And lets not forget lupe.. </p>
