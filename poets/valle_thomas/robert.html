---

 <h1>Robert  Frost your muse has called</h1> <p>what he  sd, had to for it was in him<br />
that  kindness (like all things reversed<br />
love put  him back on the wall, she nailed<br />
him<br />
that all  that was left, was more road nights<br />&amp; yr  death man, his words<br />
in that  room, it was simple to say:<br />
all that  dark on him&amp; in his hand<br />
those  miles between the hate / the actual<br />
somewhere  else.<br />
The  principle being a ring, a letter he<br />
carried  and he meaning every word of it...<br />
oh  christ, the pain on those bones<br />
his the  pain choking him, i will tell you<br />
of this  man, who put himself in a bag<br />
in order  to die, so that he cld live<br />
away from  it... ( so she wld look down on<br />  him from  a billboard</p> <p>of the  world.</p> <p>Copyright &copy;2006 Thomas G. Valle </p>
