<h1>A Minute  In The Mind Of A Poet</h1>
<p>this work  was done, a death view of paradise<br />&amp;  probably not the end, of it last night<br />(what a  magnificent day, i said to myself<br />&quot;fine&quot;  everyone i know your draught, savant<br />i regard  all of you, their are no lives that<br />rebuff,  their own uninterested day or night<br />of  self-love, a movement to wail, into space,<br />moments  to argues pine there time<br />as far as  i can see a trimmer of seconds<br />i don't  live to isobront my speech, nor<br />egest my  words, while sleeping on a bed of<br />fasten  coexistence, with a whitesmith<br />to mold  my disparage, not me, not i, not <br />overweening,  nor self-indulgence with<br />  idolatry
