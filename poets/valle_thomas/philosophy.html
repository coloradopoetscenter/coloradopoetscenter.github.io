            <h1>My  Philosophy Of Living</h1>
            <p>when my  mind feels so full, then<br />
              another  thought comes to mine<br />
              the name  is daily living, say so, like rain<br />
              some one  might say, the way advocates live<br />
          speaking  from the heart/making the dumb talk</p>
            <p>founded  not by work of monks, or clergy<br />
              from the  dark platform of night<br />
              the  attitude of change came upon me<br />
              not from  poe or keats, but my english<br />
              bulldog,  who sleeps on a blue chair, in my<br />
              living  room, his pine cone tail and tooth<br />
          that  protrudes from the left side of his mouth</p>
            <p>these  thoughts come and go not daily but<br />
              yearly,  take pleasure in yourself, take pleasure in being an advocate.</p>
            <p>beware  the size might amaze you</p>
