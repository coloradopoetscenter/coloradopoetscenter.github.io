            <h1>Universal  Time</h1>
            <p>trees  stand as guards<br />
              somewhat  staggered afar<br />
              every  brown branch silent<br />
              near but  not disturbed<br />
              somewhere  large needle cones<br />
          passing  through a tunnel</p>
            <p>and  someplace a calm lake<br />
              curling  waves pounding shorelines<br />
              survived  silence above paths<br />
              and  uncovered tracks<br />
          i fall</p>
            <p>branches  rustle in the wind.</p>
            <p>None</p>
