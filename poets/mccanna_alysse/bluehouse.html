  <h1>blue house</h1>  <p>He says,<br /> Think of the ring of moisture left on a table  on a hot day, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the index of a cold glass even after it&rsquo;s gone.<br /> And I say<br /> Yes.<br /> He flicks his cigarette absentmindedly <br /> and the ash lands on his shoe and he coughs.<br /> Do you love me?<br /> And I say<br /> I don&rsquo;t think I do.<br /> He says,<br /> Okay.<br /> We are sitting on the porch of a light blue  house<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with an old wooden swing.<br /> I feel displaced.<br /> I am worried about this.<br /> He is staring at the brave grass poking through  the cracks in the sidewalk,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am pretending I am not watching him.<br /> I say,<br /> Am I the table or the glass?<br /> And he doesn&rsquo;t say anything <br /> because how could he possibly explain this <br /> to me in a way I would understand?<br /> His eyes shut softly <br /> and I watch the sun climb above <br /> the trees in the front yard.<br /> It is morning,<br /> and still.<br /> I say, Let&rsquo;s go inside, I&rsquo;m getting cold.<br /> He follows me in, steps on my heel.<br /> I walk up the stairs.<br /> He turns to close the screen door<br /> and says in a voice I can&rsquo;t hear,<br />  You will always be the glass. </p>
