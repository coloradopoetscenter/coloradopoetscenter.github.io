  <h1>Watertown</h1>  <p>1<br />
This  summer<br />
the  tree is growing<br />
into  our house, <br />
its  branches are <br />
pushing  through the roof<br />
like  hungry seedlings<br />
through  moist spring dirt.</p>  <p>Our  porch is canopied,<br /> our  view enveloped,<br /> a  wavering green sky<br /> and the  occasional<br /> surefooted  maneuvering<br /> of a  squirrel.</p>  <p>2<br /> The air  is hot<br /> and  thick, feels<br /> like  boiled molasses.<br /> We  stretch naked<br /> before  the window<br /> air  conditioner;<br /> it is  too hot<br /> to even  touch each other.</p>  <p>We sit  in our underwear<br /> in the  shade of the porch,<br /> where  the air is denser<br /> than  smoke,<br /> watching  the neighbor&rsquo;s dog<br /> roll in  the freshly watered grass,<br /> come up  shiny and slick<br /> as your  hair<br /> after I  have washed it.</p>  <p>3<br /> It  takes three hours<br /> to meet  you.<br /> The  name of the town<br /> clatters  in our mouths<br /> like  empty silverware.</p>  <p>We eat  lunch<br /> in the  graveyard:<br /> cool  orbs of hard-boiled eggs,<br /> sandwiches  soft with fingerprints,<br /> dried  figs that leave our mouths<br /> sticky  with seeds.<br /> We  sweep the autumn shade<br /> from  the plots;<br /> we  imagine loneliness.</p>  <p>4<br /> From  the porch<br /> in  winter<br /> I can  see the two washing machines <br /> decaying  in our backyard.<br /> Our  tree is bare,<br /> its  branches cut the sky,<br /> the  frosted poles shimmer<br /> and  shake when snow-<br /> birds  leap into flight.<br /> A cup  of coffee<br /> steams  on the railing,<br /> water  drips steadily<br /> into  icicles.</p>  <p>This is  not our home,<br /> not  this deep crunching snow,<br /> not  your imminent departure â€“<br /> the  frostbite settling in my belly<br /> tastes  of bitter petals, <br /> icy dry  as chalk;</p>  <p>Two  strangers meet<br /> on a  slippery sidewalk,<br /> they  catch each other<br /> and  stay that way,<br /> bent  inward,<br /> holding  hands.</p>
