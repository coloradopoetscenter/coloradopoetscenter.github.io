  <h1>Lime-Blossom Tea</h1>  <p>at the kitchen  table, cups and hats<br /> and hands, a still-life left unpainted.<br /> the air steams with citrus, a tinge of vinegar.<br /><br /> pickled herring served with stove potatoes<br /> cooked in a flat clay pot. someone, his aunt perhaps,<br /> speaks of her day at the hat-shop.<br /><br /> “the shape of the head is difficult to navigate.<br /> customers do not understand the art.”<br /> his mother nods in agreement.<br /><br /> after supper, a village walk.<br /> he takes sticks of twisted barley<br /> sugar from traveling gypsies,<br /><br /> tasting lime and grain, dissolving<br /> into a sour, sweet thickness<br /> his tongue cannot breach.<br /><br /> the serenity of the fading light,<br /> twinkling brown like a Bruegel,<br /> leaves his hands swinging idle at his sides:<br /><br /> they didn’t know the only thing<br /> that drove him to paint<br /> was the rising urge<br />  to strangle someone.</p>
