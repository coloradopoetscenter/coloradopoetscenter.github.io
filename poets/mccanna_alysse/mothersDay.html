  <h1>Mother's Day</h1>  <p>I  celebrated Mother&rsquo;s Day by breaking in<br />
the  gardening gloves she gave me – white with<br />
little  bunches of carrots, orange and green<br />
and  brown, now, at the fingertips, where I dug<br />
to  plant celery, cucumber, radishes –<br />
tiny  holes where rose bushes were trimmed,<br />
dried  red seeds where I stumbled accidentally<br />
into  the tomato plants.</p>  <p>My  mother tends a mighty garden but,<br /> older  now, tucks a few plastic flowers<br /> into  the mulch and admires them, always<br /> full  blooms, from the kitchen window.</p>  <p>On  Mother&rsquo;s Day she wrote me a poem<br /> (&ldquo;You  make me a mother, after all&rdquo;)<br /> and  told me that I could take any line,<br /> every  line, I wanted –</p>  <p>So,  mother, the line is this:<br />&ldquo;My  heart grew fat&rdquo;<br /> and my  heart is tipping the scales,<br /> bursting  like a ripe tomato<br /> or a  juicy orange,<br /> shining  with this love<br /> like  the tight blossom of <br /> a  yellow-eyed daisy<br /> or the  tiny fist of an infant<br /> hanging  on to your sure finger,<br /> leading  her into the opening world.</p>  <p>(reprinted with thanks from Calliope, 2010)</p>
