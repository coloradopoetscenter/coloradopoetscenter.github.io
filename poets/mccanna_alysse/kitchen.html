  <h1>kitchen-writing</h1>  <p> red sun morning, sliding up the tops of trees; aspens and pines cut the fat  drop of honey,<br /> spill a little in my teacup — orange pekoe. a shimmer on the surface when i  bump<br /> the tabletop, steady my yellow-eyed daisies with a thin, pale wrist. pen and  paper wait<br /> like patient pupils, my faithful, dog-eared companions; as i contemplate how to  write<br /> my lover’s green eyes, ceaseless interruptions flush my cheeks, a flurry of  tawdry requests<br /> – the pesky doorbell. i chew the end of the pen to bits, imagining my lover’s  blue eyes like the deepest mountain river, paling in the autumn sunlight; or,  the under-feathers<br /> of the brightest jay circling in mid-flight; or, a hyacinth, the budding blue –  wait, indigo.<br /> <br /> supper’s on, vapors of garlic and onion filling the kitchen –<br /> at my table, a sheet of unfilled lines,<br /> the pending violet night.</p>
