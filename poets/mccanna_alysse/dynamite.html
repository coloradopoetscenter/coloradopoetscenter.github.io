  <h1>Still Life with Dynamite</h1>  <p>I  wanted proof of my existence,<br /> something pulsing with life, tangible<br /> to display as evidence for passersby.<br /> I wanted thick black brushstrokes to immortalize<br /> your eyebrows and nostrils,<br /> the sloping plane of my lover&rsquo;s back,<br /> the yielding skin of a ripe pear.<br /><br /> But today I realize life is no possession,<br /> that looking through the camera lens<br /> I miss what is cut out of the frame.<br /> A soft pencil attempting to organize your anatomy<br /> keeps me from tracing your skin with my palms instead.<br /> Today I cannot live through words or pictures,<br /> these interpretations.<br /><br /> Tomorrow I will set down my instruments;<br /> tomorrow I will be preoccupied with the world.<br /> I will accept time, and fill it<br /> with the airy bricks of memory,<br /> rearrangeable and removable;<br /> I will remember<br /> to keep a pocket empty for silence,<br /> to travel well, and light.</p>
