          <h1>Still Life with Dynamite</h1>
          <p>I  wanted proof of my existence,<br />
            something pulsing with life, tangible<br />
            to display as evidence for passersby.<br />
            I wanted thick black brushstrokes to immortalize<br />
            your eyebrows and nostrils,<br />
            the sloping plane of my lover&rsquo;s back,<br />
            the yielding skin of a ripe pear.<br />
  <br />
            But today I realize life is no possession,<br />
            that looking through the camera lens<br />
            I miss what is cut out of the frame.<br />
            A soft pencil attempting to organize your anatomy<br />
            keeps me from tracing your skin with my palms instead.<br />
            Today I cannot live through words or pictures,<br />
            these interpretations.<br />
  <br />
            Tomorrow I will set down my instruments;<br />
            tomorrow I will be preoccupied with the world.<br />
            I will accept time, and fill it<br />
            with the airy bricks of memory,<br />
            rearrangeable and removable;<br />
            I will remember<br />
            to keep a pocket empty for silence,<br />
            to travel well, and light.</p>
