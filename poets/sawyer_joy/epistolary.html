<h1>Two Epistolary Sonnets</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried to write a sonnet; in  fact, the mere thought <br />makes me nervous. I guess I&rsquo;d  better explain: If you knew me,<br />you&rsquo;d know I chafe at  creative restrictions. I want to be free<br />to put the pen to paper and  say exactly what I think. (I do know a lot<br />of poets, though, who relish  using traditional forms. When taught<br />the archaic Petrarchan form  with its drone of <em>abba&hellip;cde&hellip;cde&hellip;</em><br />it unleashed [at least for  them] all that repressed, innate creativity<br />they already had. However, it  doesn&rsquo;t work for me.) I&rsquo;ve caught<br />a lot of flak for this, but  honestly: Why not let the Italians do it?<br />To them, it&rsquo;s as natural as  breathing. Think of the subtle way<br />they&rsquo;ve mastered the form.  They&rsquo;re not obvious. They don&rsquo;t pre-rehearse<br />the rhyme scheme, so it&rsquo;s  rarely contrived. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t care one bit<br />what MFA programs require.  I&rsquo;m just not a stuffy sonnet-writer. I&rsquo;ll pay<br />  top dollar to attend your  school, but I&rsquo;m warning you: I only write free verse.</p>

<p>I hate to bother you again,  but it&rsquo;s imperative. You see,<br />not only do I <em>not </em>write  sonnets&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never read Shakespeare,<br />either. I once saw <em>Romeo  and Juliet</em>, but freaked out when she<br />flashed her bottom on the  screen. (At 13, I was still rather fear-<br />ful of those things.) I knew  there was no way I could hide<br />this fact from you people,  being the poetry experts you are.<br />I was thinking that <em>even</em> if you offered me a full ride,<br />I&rsquo;d have to turn it down, on  principle. Frankly, I know I&rsquo;m a far<br />cry from Edgar Guest or Ogden  Nash, but I try hard. I&rsquo;m slow,<br />but my high school basketball  coach said I compensate with &ldquo;scrap<br />and grit.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m an underdog,  like Larry and Curly are to Moe.)<br />Sorry, but your  &ldquo;Shakespearean-sonnet-is-KING&rdquo; agenda is a trap<br />for many aspiring poets, not  just me. I hope this doesn&rsquo;t sound terse,<br />  but how else do I convince  you academics I only write free verse?</p>
