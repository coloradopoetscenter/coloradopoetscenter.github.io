<h1>When You Leave Us</h1>
<p>When you move wordlessly <br />from one life into another, <br />you bring all who ever  declared our love--<br />  with our hearts, with our  mouths.</p>
<p>We all see a new maple, a  bush on fire,<br />a tiny sparrow perched on a  flat rock.</p>
<p>Though you&rsquo;ve made your  entrance into a new home,<br />our old homes are full of the  things&nbsp; <br />you loved. You live on  mantles, in journals, <br />  on recipe cards smudged with  sugar cookie dough.</p>
<p>Is nothing nearer than love  itself--<br />even when life carefully  tucks you in,<br />closes your bedroom window,<br />  whispers its soft goodnight? </p>
<p>When midnight falls, <br />we are certain you hear our  voices,<br />low and full on brick patios, <br />  ice cubes swirling in our  paper cups.</p>
<p>If we listen carefully, <br />underneath the crickets <br />and the murmur of twilight,<br />  we will hear you breathing--</p>
<p>as steady <br />as this slow dance that  begins among us,<br />  underneath the patient stars.</p>
