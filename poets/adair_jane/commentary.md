<ul><li><em>Architecturally  speaking this poet lays down a road, then a stream, then a sky of stars.  &nbsp;Everything you need to make the journey is there. &nbsp;This poet knows  the power of provocative endings. – </em>Nikky Finney</li><li><em>This is what  we like about the poet: an ability to be distracted that enriches the poem and  then the return . . . – </em>Judges, University of Canberra International Poetry Prize</li><li><em>Rhythm  propels these poems… Sassy. Unflinching. Unsentimental. </em>– Judges,  Colorado Council on the Arts. </li>
