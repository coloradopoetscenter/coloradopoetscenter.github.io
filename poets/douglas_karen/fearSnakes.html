title: Fear of Snakes

  <h1>Fear  of Snakes </h1>  <p>On  the sidewalk, a clutch of three <br /> tiny  plastic toys. I flinch, step around them. Too late,<br /> they  have wriggled into memory and pulled out<br /> a  long black racer in Georgia, shooting<br /> under  my child’s swing with her in it--screams<br /> and  rescue from a shape, a movement already<br /> gone,  until we watch from behind a glass door<br /> as  our snake swallows a frog on the front walk.</p>  <p>It  must get seismic messages through its belly.<br /> We  stretch out on raised beds, second-story sleepers. <br /> I  meant to think about snakes, but my mind leaped away<br /> as  if the word could coil and strike at bare ankles.<br /> I  turned away, afraid to step into the tall grass<br /> where  I cannot see what’s ahead until I get there,<br /> where  I may meet a narrow fellow or some other thing<br /> leaping,  scaring me back onto the path well traveled.</p>  <p>The  black racer owns the yard. Our guardian snake<br /> defends  us against worse versions of its tribe.</p>  <p>(Accepted  for publication in Blue  Five Notebook,  2011) </p>
