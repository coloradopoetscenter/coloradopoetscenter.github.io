title: Karen Douglass : The Drinking Circle

  <h1>The  Drinking Circle</h1>  <p>First  his father leaves.<br /> His  mother leaves him<br /> her  empties for playthings<br /> gleaming  in the Florida sun.</p>  <p>His  little row boat bobs on the lake<br /> like  a wine cork. Wind<br /> in  his face makes a thirst.<br /> Every  fish he pulls in gleams</p>  <p>like  a bottle. At last call<br /> he  drains another job to the dregs.<br /> Two  wives, two sons, his only book<br /> of  poems flicker and dim.</p>  <p>At  the end he cradles his cat,<br /> swirls  vodka and Crystal Lite together,<br /> sees  in the bottom of the glass a lake, a boat<br /> and  a boy, baited and hooked.</p>  <p>(Accepted  for publication in Chantarelleâ€™s  Notebook,  2011)</p>
