  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>Stunning, easily  one of the best I've read so far this year., June 23, 2010<br />
By&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2EDZH51XHFA9B/ref=cm_cr_rdp_pdp">Robert P. Beveridge &quot;xterminal&quot;</a></p>  <p>Karen Douglass,  Red Goddess Poems (Cafe Review Press, 1992) </p>  <p>I have certain  bookstores scattered throughout the east and midwest that I have a special  affection for, usually because I found some gem or another at them. I'm not  even sure most of them still exist; my days of vacations that morphed into long  afternoons spent combing dusty secondhand bookstores are long behind me. But I  was up in Maine for my brother's wedding a couple of weeks ago, and for this  reason I had a chance to visit one of them, the Big Chicken Barn in Ellsworth.  I made fairly regular trips there in the 1980s, and both my book and record  collections were greatly enriched every time. I got there late and had barely  an hour to browse this time round, which was probably for the best (I got out  spending just $12, rather than the $75-100 I was expecting to, and with only  one grocery sack full of books, which made my wife very happy), but the first  book I grabbed at random out of that sack when I got home was pure gold--Karen  Douglass' 1992 chapbook <em>Red Goddess Poems</em>,  which I'd never even heard of when I grabbed it off the shelf. It was published  by the Cafe Review, a Portland-based magazine that, I just found out with a  quick Google search, is still around after all these years. While quality is no  guarantee of survival in the small-press world, if their taste in everything is  as impeccable as it was when they grabbed Douglass, their continued survival is  very well-deserved. </p>  <p>When I started  reading, I figured it was going to be a three-star book. The poems in the first  half are solid work, strong without overly distinguishing themselves (which  still makes them better than most of the poetry I've read so far this year).  Good stuff, but not something that commands reading more than once every few  years. Then something changes. I'm not entirely sure what, but the pieces get  more expansive, darker, sexier, uglier. </p>  <p>&quot;Lace clings  to a body in need <br /> of sun; a body  should be licked to just <br /> mocha. She wears  her gown like an impulse, </p>  <p>put on so she can  put it off. And we cannot <br /> bring ourselves  to say trite to a tight <br /> bodice, low cut,  scarved in opportunity.&quot; <br /> (&quot;Silk  Forgets that Bodies Crack and Burn&quot;) </p>  <p>Douglass pushes  into someplace that is familiar, yet not. Someplace we don't think we  necessarily want to go, but feel compelled to follow. And now that I think  about it, that's a pretty darned good definition of poetry to go with my  oft-used phrase about elevated language. Karen Douglass gets it. And while I'm  sure this book has been out of print for almost twenty years now, so should  you. A no-brainer for my ten best reads of the year list. **** Â½ </p>
