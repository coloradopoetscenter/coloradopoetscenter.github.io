  <h1>Zero  Gravity </h1>  <p>My  spirit has unraveled, <br /> a  knotted hank of yarn.</p>  <p>I  would invite it to become<br /> blue-green,  shimmering<br /> with  flecks of light, gauzy,<br /> a  long scarf flying over the city,<br /> wrapping  the world at its waist</p>  <p>just  to touch what is, not<br /> arrogant  with change or even healing,<br /> twining  with strands of other souls,<br /> glowing,  decorating the globe,<br /> a  shield against cruelty,<br /> a  kiss on Earthâ€™s forehead.</p>
