          <h1>Zero  Gravity </h1>
          <p>My  spirit has unraveled, <br />
            a  knotted hank of yarn.</p>
          <p>I  would invite it to become<br />
            blue-green,  shimmering<br />
            with  flecks of light, gauzy,<br />
            a  long scarf flying over the city,<br />
            wrapping  the world at its waist</p>
          <p>just  to touch what is, not<br />
            arrogant  with change or even healing,<br />
            twining  with strands of other souls,<br />
            glowing,  decorating the globe,<br />
            a  shield against cruelty,<br />
            a  kiss on Earthâ€™s forehead.</p>
