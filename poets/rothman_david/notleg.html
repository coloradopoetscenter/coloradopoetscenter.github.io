<h1>Not My Leg</h1>
<p>Not  my leg,<br />
My  lean, strong leg.<br />
Choose  any other part,<br />
But  please don&rsquo;t start<br />
With  my lovely leg.<br />
I&rsquo;d  look bad with a peg.</p>
<p>Not  my hand,<br />My  articulate hand.<br />Please  don&rsquo;t let it<br />Get  torn or shredded.<br />Writing  this book<br />Would  be hard with a hook &mdash; <br />You  must understand<br />  I  need my hand.</p>
<p>Not  my eyes,<br />Dear  God, not my eyes.<br />Don&rsquo;t  poke them out,<br />So  I grope about<br />Like  Homer, Milton, Joyce.<br />If  you have to be blind<br />To  have such a voice,<br />I  find<br />  I  want my eyes.</p>
<p>Not  the urethra, not the anus,<br />The  avenues that meekly drain us.<br />At  least if they block, or get infected,<br />Please  let it be quickly detected,<br />So  a minimum of me gets cut.<br />Leave  them alone,<br />My  necessary thrones<br />  Of  pleasure and smut.</p>
<p>Not  my body, my only body.<br />I  know that the construction&rsquo;s shoddy,<br />Not  built to last &mdash; <br />Someday  it will lie in the past &mdash; <br />Still,  I cannot restrain myself<br />From  praying for my own good health,<br />Which  some denying part of me<br />Believes  should last eternally,<br />Although  that only could hold true<br />For  something out of nature&rsquo;s view,<br />  And  not my body, not my body.</p>
