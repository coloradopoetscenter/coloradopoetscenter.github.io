<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p>&quot;The qualities I  love in David Rothman&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;vitality, variety and precision&mdash;are those I love  in all the best poets. Whether he&rsquo;s writing about China,  New York or  the Western Slope of Colorado, his poems bring me close to his own wildly  learned personality. <em>The Elephant&rsquo;s  Chiropractor </em>is by turns funny, and deeply moving; its art affirms  life.&quot;&nbsp; -- David Mason&quot;</p>
<p>What impresses one  first about David J. Rothman is his immense imaginative and intellectual range,  but the more one reads his striking and exuberant poetry the more deeply one  feels its emotional force and quiet but genuine ferocity. He is an Apollonian  touched by the divine madness of Dionysus. Diverse, demanding, and delightful,  his poems abundantly reward the reader&rsquo;s attention.&quot; -- Dana Gioia</p>
<p>&quot;These wonderful  poems are by a man who has wandered around inside of himself a long time,  knocking on door after door, discovering in the end that the world is his  lover.&quot; -- James Tipton</p>
<p>&quot;You can almost  hear Rothman&rsquo;s heart pounding triumphantly as he seizes upon and captures yet  another of the small, ephemeral, but ultimately defining moments that can bring  a soul to its knees or raise it to the heavens.&quot;&nbsp; -- Lynda La Rocca</p>
