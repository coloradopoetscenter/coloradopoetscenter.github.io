              <h1>Breaking the Jug</h1>
              <p>I  held the gallon jug in my right hand,<br />
One  finger curling into its mouth like a question,<br />
And  I hurled it at the wall.&nbsp; It had a decent  heft,<br />
The  unsurprising sense of a thing as it is.<br />
It  was not a beautiful jug, or old,<br />
No  more valuable than the jug we break<br />
Whenever  we open our eyes.<br />
A  little wine roiled in the bottom,<br />
Stoically  concealing the past.<br />
The  jug floated like a small green cloud,<br />
Ruling  the apartment&rsquo;s gray, bare sky.<br />
When  it touched the wall<br />
There  was a moment when its axis<br />
And  the gigantic axis of the world<br />
Crossed  for the last time, like swords.<br />
Its  cheap seam glinted tragically<br />
For  things are always ready for this cue.<br />
Then  the jug blew apart under the impact of laws<br />
That  flood out into life.&nbsp; The shards of glass<br />
And  drops of wine scattered like a busted paradise,<br />
Fulfilling  slovenly equations of gravity and momentum<br />
Where  they could come to a mosaic rest.</p>
              <p>We  lay spattered with wreckage, laughing.<br />
                The  room was bathed in the continuing light<br />
                Of  an afternoon.&nbsp; As shadows slowly traveled<br />
                Away  from themselves, the brilliant shards<br />
                Sparkled  like the traffic coursing the streets below,<br />
                Each  shoe and hubcap searching for that destination<br />
                Where  all things might join again with light and love<br />
          And  thereby return to their senses.</p>
