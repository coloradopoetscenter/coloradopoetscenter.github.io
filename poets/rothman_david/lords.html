<h1>One of the Lords of Life </h1>
<p>Peace  to all living things,<br />
I  scribbled in the log on VulturePeak<br />
Because  time was short and it was true.<br />
Then  I stood, like any American, alone,<br />
To  be in that immense desert glow.<br />
Down  into dusk, the Hieroglyphics and the White Tanks,<br />
The  Big Horns, the Harquehalas, and the Bradshaws<br />
Offered  bent, brown rock, forests of saguaros,<br />
And  hidden life to the emerging stars.</p>
<p>Lampless,  I turned and scrambled three-point<br />Down  the chimney, blaze to blaze,<br />Until  I met the saddle dirt,<br />Then  bounded down a crooked trail<br />  Into  the darkness growing visible.</p>
<p>A  whisper in the shape of a green branch<br />Lay  before me.&nbsp; Wonder not, it said.<br />And  so I did not wait, although it ruled the path.<br />I  had no chance to stop and listen<br />To  the quiet voices of my education.<br />Only  when I landed on my right foot<br />One  runner&rsquo;s pace above did it become<br />A  sinuous emperor of emerald<br />Warming  himself on a rock in the patience<br />  Of  silence, cunning, and exile.</p>
<p>Nature  does not suffer decay: always new,<br />Unlike  the memory on which minds turn,<br />It  unfolds like emptiness.<br />One  word, his name, sparked from nowhere<br />And  sank into my foot.<br />A  hand reached down, carved wings,<br />Then  plucked my muscles with more light.<br />Too  big for dinner, too sudden for his surprise<br />To  coil up and rattle out an argument,<br />I  jumped into the current of our doing.<br />Pebbles  tinkled like dice<br />As  I leapt over the fat green snake<br />Who  squirmed silently beneath my soles<br />Like  a piece of animal cactus,<br />And  I did not fall, I landed with a gravel crunch<br />Between  the cacti, unstung, miraculously erect,<br />No  mouth of numbing ash, no broken ankle,<br />  Below  the double distance a rattler can strike.</p>
<p>Strange  alteration in me.&nbsp; The fruit was praise.<br />Mojave  green: I do not think I missed my chance<br />With  you, but took it where it lay &mdash; <br />As  if I had the choice.<br />You  are still prompting my words<br />Away  from deep, high speculation<br />And  into one breath after another &mdash; <br />The  coincidence of dusk and sage,<br />The  distant glow of Phoenix,  and the dying sun.<br />As  I climb slowly up into these thoughts,<br />Remembering  my long, headlong descent,<br />On  which I lost the trail, then found it again<br />And  walked out from the mountains in darkness,<br />I  see you turning, raising your head in cold curiosity<br />As  I vanish beneath your jaw, and I hear you calling my name,<br />  Although  you are ignorant of it.</p>
