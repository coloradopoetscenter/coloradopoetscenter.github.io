              <h1>Going Downhill </h1>
              <p>Eager to commit metaphor, heartbreak, and other angelic mistakes<br />
                And ambitious for far more than grades, I decided to ditch school and go skiing,<br />
                So therefore briefly leapt into a number of dead-end jobs to fund my questions.<br />
                Julie couldn&rsquo;t believe I cared so much about mountains,<br />
                So when he came to visit she threw herself on and off Cliff, my roommate<br />
                Although there were probably a lot of other reasons for it as well,<br />
                Including the fact that he was irresistibly charming<br />
                And I certainly had my flaws.  But at any rate I decided<br />
                In the foolish, stubborn, unforgiving way of young people everywhere<br />
                That that was the end of that, although I thought it was funny<br />
                When Cliff explained what had happened by describing life as an eternally unfolding flower.<br />
                And yet how could I not now still love them both in that passion-tangled memory<br />
                Where in faith only love can sustain any arc of worthy meanings.<br />
                For who could ever give up such roots of the sea, such secret wounds.<br />
                Let it be a liability, let it be a blessing, let evening fall, let the gardens and jungles of the warm earth sigh.<br />
                I spent the summer living in Cambridge reshelving books<br />
                Deep in the mind of Widener, the trucks rumbling with knowledge,<br />
                Hiding in the stacks to read whatever struck my fancy for hours<br />
                And engaging in adventures to be documented elsewhere<br />
                With tremendous formal discipline and sprezzatura,<br />
                To include erotic alliances, drug overdoses, heat waves, long runs by the river,<br />
                Purple discussions about God and jazz, deep desire, and the beauty of C.,<br />
                Scholar, archer, unattainable Petrarchan moon, who taught both English and scotch.<br />
                Although one liaison that is relevant &ndash; working as a secretary and ghost editor<br />
                For an old woman who claimed she had been on the first attempt on Nanga Parbat,<br />
                The Naked Mountain of Pakistan, eighth highest in the world and deadly,<br />
                But was now beginning to lose it and living alone in a hotel apartment<br />
                Trying to write a novel based on her experiences, old, old,<br />
                Smelling and looking old, the pages confused on the floor<br />
                Forgetting what she had asked me to do from one week to the next.<br />
                Something told me that she had been strong and beautiful once &ndash; <br />
                Climbing in wool, leather, nylon, laughing and dangling from precipices,<br />
                And I could not imagine then what I know now &ndash; how every fair sometime declines<br />
                From the stunning vitality of youth and the beauty of dangerous places.<br />
                Then a few months back home managing a Cumberland Farms convenience store,<br />
                Stalking the cooler, filling out daily receipts, ordering milk, processing food stamps,<br />
                Before scraping my money together and jumping to Aspen<br />
                To tutor young, hopeful, racer charges at the Aspen Ski Academy<br />
                In return for room, board, lift tickets, training privileges and a map of the world.<br />
                Impossible to describe the joy upon that high arrival, flying in,<br />
                Enormous spine of the Rockies rising up to the small plane from Stapleton.<br />
                And then the high air, heart palpitations for weeks at night,<br />
                To admire that beauty while alive and also then and there feel so deeply part of it,<br />
                Even when coughing up pieces of lung, and to be strong and ready to work like a prime number<br />
                In the algorithm of my own unfolding life.  If only there could be more,<br />
                More of everything, the way there was that year, forever.<br />
                More love, more happiness, more mountains, more snow, more days,<br />
                More friends, more music, more learning, more races, more poetry, more delight,<br />
                More gods, more girls.  I need no well-wrought urn to know it,<br />
                It reaches out to touch me, in this tranquility it washes over me<br />
                And over this quiet evening like an ontological proof of something divine,<br />
                To wake every morning, the great mountains returned from their night,<br />
                And practice Tai Chi with Click, Mausner, Bill, Chris, Sally, Al,<br />
                Then to teach all morning, all of us digging in on chores at lunch,<br />
                Then up to the hill, Golden Horn at Highlands, skis glued to the snow<br />
                As we rode laps on the poma and tightened every line like screws,<br />
                Then off to races, like the time we piled into the van in a storm,<br />
                Humped over McClure in fuzzy blackness then had to navigate<br />
                The North Rim of the Black as if hunting for quasars in an endless night,<br />
                Human laundry lost in an enormous spin cycle, until we finally arrived in Gunnison,<br />
                Picked up the college radio station and limped into Crested Butte<br />
                With almost no idea of where we were, nerves scraped and rattled and rolled<br />
                At infinite backwash midnight, the snow banks as high as the streetlamps,<br />
                The race canceled the next day because the gates had almost forgotten themselves<br />
                In the fresh and so we all went howling and laughing off of cliffs into cold feather beds,<br />
                Then adjourned to Sunshine&rsquo;s coed naked bathhouse like young, hopeful roosters<br />
                While outside the mercury headed for the interstellar basement.<br />
                And one day, after Rossignol had failed to come through with my new, first 220 downhills,<br />
                Forrest, for whom I worked with Vern and the boys tuning boards and fitting rental boots at Bell Mt. Sports<br />
                Got his old Austrian friend Willy, the Colorado Kneissl rep, to bring me a pair<br />
                Of the longest, sweetest White Stars you ever saw, just in time for the Sunlight downhill,<br />
                Presented to me like Excalibur over gemutlichheit in the tune room because Forrest and Willy loved racing,<br />
                Still hanging in my garage like a trophy rack lo these decades later,<br />
                And Willy had chosen well and those skis were like rockets.<br />
                I would put them on the snow and they would whisper like silk, wouldn&rsquo;t even really turn<br />
                Until you hit about 35, and then it was as if a tiger had suddenly jumped under your feet<br />
                Crouched, and pounced and in mid-air you became the tiger,<br />
                Thinking only forward and down, steel claws sprouting, feeling the world unfold again and again<br />
                In a kind of slow splendor in which, surprisingly, nothing happened quickly,<br />
                Assuming you stayed upright, a good idea because as Klammer der Kaiser once pointed out,<br />
                When asked about falling, &ldquo;Good downhillers don&rsquo;t fall.&rdquo;<br />
                And when the annual Town Downhill came around and was set on the course where we trained,<br />
                Racer&rsquo;s Edge at Tiehack, 1700 vertical and a mile long in less than a minute,<br />
                Dude, I have to tell you in the only language I can that I was way, way stoked,<br />
                Like a sizzling woodstove in a cabin at tree line stuffed with logs until it has started to glow.<br />
                Willy&rsquo;s skis were quick, quick quicksilver, brushed, prepped and waxed to train rails on fire,<br />
                They spoke in a whisper that would rise to a quiet roar at about 50.<br />
                Twelve turns, that&rsquo;s all, nice rhythm back and forth, a great launcher at the first drop<br />
                Where you had to remember that the trick isn&rsquo;t the speed, it&rsquo;s the acceleration,<br />
                Line it up, hands forward, turn when you see the top of the big pine and go,<br />
                Then down, down the winding stair on purpose and free as a wave,<br />
                Like a primeval element, like a pure fact of mountain, thinking like it, transforming laws into play,<br />
                Until somewhere around 70 things would become quiet, calm, almost slow,<br />
                Nothing visible or mattering except the track, the line, where possibilities glittered<br />
                With the incorruptible structure of diamonds and the smallest articulations<br />
                Could move the earth like an enormous lever, or like what a hawk sees turning in his meditation<br />
                Of the distant boiling sun, almost outrun at last, everything passing by so quickly<br />
                That it has been forced to slow into silence and stillness, the world a statue,<br />
                Your body the fastest thing of any kind for miles around, your mind opened like a windsock<br />
                Or a naked eyeball, universal currents whispering along your edges<br />
                About a freedom, a liberation, an unleashing of every quantum wave&rsquo;s options,<br />
                A moment that lasts forever in its purity, its utter touch and song,<br />
                Like a sequence of chords that opens a window somewhere, a woman singing&hellip;<br />
                Until suddenly time falls out of itself, bounces like an apple dropped on a hard wood floor,<br />
                You pull up and throw your skis sideways in a long sweet hockey skid and as the danger peels away<br />
                The world returns, comes back into the dull roar of becoming, as if you have stepped back down<br />
                Out of truth into a cave which is the same world but somehow more confusing<br />
                And your coach and friends come up to you and say &ldquo;Nice run!  You&rsquo;re in 10th,&rdquo;<br />
                And everyone else is standing around smiling and blissful as if they&rsquo;ve just made love to the moon.<br />
                And then for the rest of the day it feels as if every hair on your body is singing, electric,<br />
                Every pore is aching to return to that province of transformation,<br />
                Every dark bud on your tongue claims to have tasted immortality,<br />
                No doubt the way they feel after a big day riding giants at Sunset, Pipeline, Jaws, Waimea Bay or Mavericks,<br />
                No doubt the way they feel after repairing bolts on the space station, or free soloing El Cap,<br />
                Or kayaking Lava at high water in the Grand or, as we all know it can be, making a new friend<br />
                Or falling in love or teaching a child how to add fractions,<br />
                When even in your dreams you are flying, flying, changed, alive, utterly in love with the world,<br />
                Utterly compelled in the grip of its necessary gravity yet utterly willing,<br />
                Every obscure forest in which you find yourself now merely a means to glide downward on extended wings into the wildest grace.<br />
