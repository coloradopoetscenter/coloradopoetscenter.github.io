<h1>Introduction to Icarus</h1>
<p>Edith Hamilton lurked behind the  door <br />of the formal dining room like  Elijah <br />  waiting for my father&rsquo;s invitation  to the table </p>
<p>she always wore the same little  black cover <br />of the 1969 Mentor paperback  edition<br />  though in my child&rsquo;s imagination</p>
<p>she became the photograph <br />of my great grandmother Margery<br />  in her professional pearls and her  scholarly tweeds</p>
<p>leaning on the low wall in the  campus rose garden <br />smiling wisely into the  twenty-first century<br />  and beginning to explain how wings  could melt</p>
