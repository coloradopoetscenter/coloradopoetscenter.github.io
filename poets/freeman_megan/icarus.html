              <h1>Introduction to Icarus</h1>
              <p>Edith Hamilton lurked behind the  door <br />
                of the formal dining room like  Elijah <br />
          waiting for my father&rsquo;s invitation  to the table </p>
              <p>she always wore the same little  black cover <br />
                of the 1969 Mentor paperback  edition<br />
          though in my child&rsquo;s imagination</p>
              <p>she became the photograph <br />
                of my great grandmother Margery<br />
          in her professional pearls and her  scholarly tweeds</p>
              <p>leaning on the low wall in the  campus rose garden <br />
                smiling wisely into the  twenty-first century<br />
          and beginning to explain how wings  could melt</p>
