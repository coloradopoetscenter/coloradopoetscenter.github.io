              <h1>Divorcing California Takes Time</h1>
              <p>growing up in Los Angeles<br />
                city of tamales and lucky cats  waving from the top shelf<br />
                pasty white girl towering over  brown friends with killer serves on the court<br />
                white bread alphabetized between  Fernandez and Gonzaga<br />
                power lines draping the streets  like crepe paper and pi&ntilde;atas<br />
                hills green for twenty minutes in  the spring and then wildfire ashes<br />
                falling on the playground at  recess commingling with the smog<br />
                like cinnamon and sugar on a  churro <br />
          we washed our hair every day rinsed  and repeated</p>
              <p>nighttime helicopters with  searchlights like Hollywood<br />
                chuttering and chopping through  the never-dark ET sky&nbsp; <br />
                glowing from movie stars&rsquo; color  TV&rsquo;s somewhere above the big white sign<br />
                behind their big white gates where  they washed the famous cement <br />
          out from under their fingernails</p>
              <p>eyes straight ahead through the  park<br />
                smell of funny smoke from the  amphitheater<br />
                navigating between the cholos and  the perverts <br />
                to get to Algebra before the  second bell<br />
                safety in numbers <br />
                homecoming game in the Rose Bowl<br />
                makes me want to brag we were so  cool<br />
                kicking Franklin&rsquo;s ass in our  imaginations<br />
                spending New Year&rsquo;s Eve in the  gutters making out and waiting<br />
          watching to confirm that our float  was the bitchin&rsquo;est of them all</p>
              <p>city looks cleaner, tidier from  the air above LAX<br />
                rusty Spanglish dusts itself off as the cabin pressure  changes in my brain<br />
                while cravings for Ernie Jr.&rsquo;s and Casa Bianca mix on my  tongue<br />
                the spongy air washes over my high  altitude dry skin<br />
          absorbing oleander and eucalyptus  and sea salt and leaf-blower fumes</p>
              <p>divorcing California takes time</p>
