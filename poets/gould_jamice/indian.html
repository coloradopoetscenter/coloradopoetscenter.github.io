          <h1>Indian Mascot, 1959</h1>
          <p>Now begins the festival and rivalry of late fall,<br />
            the weird debauch and daring debacle<br />
            of frat-boy parties as students parade foggy streets in mock<br />
            processions, bearing on shoulders scrawny effigies of dead<br />
            defeated Indians cut from trees, where,<br />
          in the twilight, they had earlier been hung.</p>
          <p>“Just dummies,” laughs our dad, “Red  Indians hung<br />
            or burned—it’s only in jest.”    Every fall<br />
            brings the Big Game against Stanford, where<br />
            young scholars let off steam before the debacle<br />
            they may face of failed exams.   “You’re dead<br />
            wrong,” he says to Mom, “They don’t mock</p>
          <p>real, live Indians.”  Around  U.C. campus mock<br />
            lynchings go on.  Beneath  porches we see hung<br />
            the scarecrow Natives with fake long braids, dead<br />
            from the merry-making.  On  Bancroft Way one has fallen<br />
            indecorously to a lawn, a symbol of the debacle<br />
            that happened three generations ago in California’s hills, where</p>
          <p>Native peoples were strung up.  (A way of having fun?  Where<br />
            did they go, those Indian ghosts?) “Their kids perform mock<br />
            war dances, whooping, re-enacting scenes of a debacle<br />
            white folks let loose,” chides Mom. “Meanwhile we hang<br />
            portraits of Presidents on school walls and never let fall<br />
            the old red, white, and blue.   My dear brother is dead</p>
          <p>because he fought in a white man’s war.  How many dead<br />
            Indians do they need to feel okay?   This whole thing wears<br />
            on my soul.”  In the dark car we  go silent, and the fall<br />
            night gets chillier.  In yards,  blazing bonfires mock<br />
            the stars that glow palely somewhere above.  A thin moon hangs<br />
            over the tule fogs.  I’ve never  heard the word “debacle”</p>
          <p>before and wonder what it means.   “What’s a debacle,<br />
            Mom?” I ask.  “Oh, honey, it’s a  terrible and deadly<br />
            collapse.  Complete ruin.”  I’ve noticed how the hung<br />
            Indians have their heads slumped forward.  They wear<br />
            old clothes, headbands with feathers, face paint, moc-<br />
            casins instead of boots.  Little  do we know this fall</p>
          <p>living Indians at Feather Falls <br />
            leave tobacco to mark that, indeed, <br />
            we’re still here, lungs full of indigenous air.</p>
