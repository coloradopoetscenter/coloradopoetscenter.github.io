  <h1>Tribal History </h1>  <p>When I think of my mother’s hands,<br /> brown and square, fingers slightly bent<br /> from years of work, I consider<br /> all the other hands of Concow Maidu folk,<br /> bound, prepared<br /> for the lynching at the crooked oak<br /> along the mountain road near<br /> the town of Cherokee.<br /> It stood not far from the meadows <br />  where our ancestral people made their home.</p>  <p>This was in the time when white men<br /> scoured those hills, breaking them<br /> down into rubble in a crazy<br /> search for gold.  The treaty  with the Concow<br /> would not be ratified by Congress,<br /> for Indians were in the way of Progress,<br /> and though a promise had been made<br /> to provide corn starch and other commodities<br /> to every man who made his X<br /> on that scrap of parchment,<br /> the only X the white men made<br /> was to cross the hands of Indians<br /> behind their backs before swinging them<br /> out over the lava walls of the canyon.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Originally titled “Bound Poem #2,” this poem was written as  a “found” poem under timed conditions for the Housewarming Celebration at the  newly opened Poetry Center at the University of Arizona in October, 2007.</p>
