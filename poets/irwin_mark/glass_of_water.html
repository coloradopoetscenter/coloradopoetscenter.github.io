<p> The stars, for the glimpsing, </p>
<p> for the gazing beyond. A crush of stars </p>
<p> heavy with the dark October sky. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> --Or red blood cells scattered on the slide&rsquo;s white </p>
<p> field. Worlds without, worlds within. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Yesterday, in the tall grass </p>
<p> by a creek below mountains and forming </p>
<p> mountains of cloud, there was </p>
<p> nothing I wanted to possess, I who love </p>
<p> the flesh so much and try to make </p>
<p> a house within poems. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> When my clumsy hand first learned to write <em>yes</em></p>
<p> I placed a sun over trees by a river </p>
<p> and realized much later </p>
<p> yes cannot be written. And <em>no</em> is a stone growing larger </p>
<p> until it shrinks, finally unnoticed </p>
<p> within the mountain. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Petru sang in the choir in Bucharest, sang in the choir </p>
<p> as a boy, and later worked as a barber in Auschwitz </p>
<p> where his jaw and teeth were broken. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Now he sells auto parts in Cleveland. He says </p>
<p> radiator and wipes the spit from his chin. </p>
<p><em> Marina,</em> he says, <em>her name was Marina.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Pour a glass of water in sunlight. Now lift </p>
<p> it toward your mouth and try to imagine </p>
<p> the same act in a fleshless world. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> The sky&rsquo;s swarming with stars. To sing </p>
<p> nothing into being. Grass, trees, </p>
<p> and clouds. Just try. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
