<h1>Song
</h1>
<p>--To whistle once into a forever wind.</p>
<p>And the light from the sky pooled around us.</p>
<p>We put our hands into it and rubbed it on others, ones distant<br />or gone.</p>
<p>And chance assigned us a time, and our bodies grew.</p>
<p>And we became aware, then our bodies grew tired, and our minds<br />were taken away.</p>
<p>Yes, some of us have been found, but what&rsquo;s lost<br />often remains forever.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the middle of October an April occurs, and we marvel<br />at green bursting through the papery yellow,<br />  then it snows and the sun comes out all across the white page.</p>
<p>And you stand there, dusted in a brightness, moving alone.</p>
<p>Mark Irwin</p>
