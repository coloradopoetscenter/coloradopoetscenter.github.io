<h1>Autumn
</h1>
<p>Why am I so afraid as the cidery smell<br />of apples lingers in the air? Was it that long ago<br />I rushed to the wilderness and was married<br />to the green? Why now do I fear I&rsquo;ll forget my way?<br />That my wife and daughter won&rsquo;t recognize me? And why <br />at night does milk vanish from our glasses? Why?<br />I know that man walking across his roof is safe<br />because he stands above the heads of sleepy<br />children. And why do I fear the names of people<br />will be blown away? Why? Would only that sparrow feed<br />my eyes, what would I know? Why now do rooms<br />all smell of clove? And why has my house grown<br />  small? See, I bend to pick it up among the stones.</p>
