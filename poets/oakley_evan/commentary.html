              <p><em>Comments of judge Robert Hedin about poems:</em></p>
              <p>He wrote, &quot;I applaud this marvelously conceived sheaf of poems for its clarity of vision and purpose. This is a poet who is able to maintain the fine, often precarious balance between the sacred and the profane, and does so with verbal flair, tonal dexterity, a wry ironic humor, and a finely <br />
              honed craft. The poems converse across the pages to create a poetic dialogue that in the end makes each poem larger.&quot;</p>
