<h1> Construction</h1>
<p> The base was mud, but by noon had </p>
<p> baked hard across the housings, clotting </p>
<p> in sprays on chainboxes, everywhere </p>
<p> but on the sheathed chrome of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> hydraulics. Only the ditch lay clean, </p>
<p> an inch of black topsoil giving way </p>
<p> to red clay, moist and trenched sheer </p>
<p> like a steak&rsquo;s edge. The hodcarrier in it </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> panting &amp; the only one working, </p>
<p> everyone else in trucks, or back </p>
<p> in the shade of a cottonwood. </p>
<p> Nothing there could be done until </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> mix was set at the ditch&rsquo;s end &amp; the </p>
<p> mixer&rsquo;s trough didn&rsquo;t reach. So they had him </p>
<p> working it&mdash;an apprentice out of </p>
<p> Laramie, blurred runes tattooed on </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> his fingers, head shaved, with white </p>
<p> eyebrows, and a gold KKK stud </p>
<p> in his ear. He was running cement </p>
<p> from the trough on down to the end </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> by wheelbarrow. The mixer rotated </p>
<p> like a planet, its driver climbing out of </p>
<p> his cab, taking a rag and rubbing </p>
<p> talc off the door where the words <em>Hecho </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em> Valencia/Concrete-Gravel</em> were. </p>
<p> Like us he looked the hoddie over because </p>
<p> the guy was an animal, pushing the </p>
<p> barrow under the trough from behind and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> squatting down between the handles as the </p>
<p> mud poured, the trough bucking low, driving </p>
<p> his hardhat&rsquo;s brow sling down across his </p>
<p> nose hard. When he had a load he shouted, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> pushed it out from under and descended </p>
<p> along planks set in the ditch which </p>
<p> pitched and splintered as he ran them. When </p>
<p> he&rsquo;d hit the end it went on its toe </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> and the mud slid off like pudding </p>
<p> going in the trash. Then he saw </p>
<p> Valencia watching and began </p>
<p>right there to lift the empty barrow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> by the tongs, like a chair lifted by its </p>
<p> legs, and to bring it down on his own </p>
<p> head, the hat taking the weight and the </p>
<p> cold slip thick with lime covering and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> sliding off the brim, onto his shirt- </p>
<p> less torso, which was burnt red, his arm </p>
<p> pits blond and white, the skin shuddering </p>
<p> as olive remainder ran in streams </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> down to his waist, into his pants. And </p>
<p> each run he grinned up at Valencia </p>
<p> from the shadow under his wheeled </p>
<p> carapace, dripping like with shit, the </p>
<p>gold on his ear glinting. </p>
