<h1> Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness </h1>
<p> He trembled in the booth, the young man </p>
<p> with a palsy of some kind, his hand crimped, </p>
<p> spoon adrift, dark syrup inscribing arabesques </p>
<p> of terrible effort on the formica table. </p>
<p> He had come to eat ice cream in the diner, </p>
<p> to bathe the table with mucous and froth </p>
<p> under the eyes of the shy and disgusted </p>
<p> waitress. When he wished to speak, </p>
<p> his face twisted, his neck turned, as if </p>
<p> he were pushing stones with his tongue, </p>
<p> or ushering himself through the birth canal, </p>
<p> both of which seemed certainly true, </p>
<p> for it arrived in his mouth: an idea </p>
<p> crowning through blood with a mewl. </p>
<p> Amazing that he could even talk </p>
<p> given what seemed to possess him, </p>
<p> something awake along his spine </p>
<p> that made each part of him evangelize </p>
<p> in pieces of the<em> Watchtower</em> and his home </p>
<p> to come. And though it was chemistry, </p>
<p> ganglion queering the electrical flow, </p>
<p> I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that his spasms, </p>
<p> the abrupt evasions, jerk and heave, </p>
<p> served to keep him out of reach </p>
<p> of that part of him which wished to die. </p>
<p> That it was only through will </p>
<p> that his hand clutched his coat&rsquo;s collar </p>
<p> and not his throat&mdash;that his tongue </p>
<p> wrought a miracle when it ordered, </p>
<p> when at last he slipped the chains sufficiently, </p>
<p> allowing him to taste.</p>
