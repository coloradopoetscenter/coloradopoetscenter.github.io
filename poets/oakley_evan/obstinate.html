<h1> For the Obstinate </h1>
<p> It was Hell. It displayed itself, a bad time </p>
<p> in full throe. Right where they always said </p>
<p> it was, down below. A deathless music </p>
<p> of shrieking strings, of poison yellow </p>
<p> clarinets. Here, the unspeakable mansions </p>
<p> were. Here, the stricken souls must slide, </p>
<p> clear out of bed, sluiced out of skin to rain </p>
<p> through floorboards, to rain like </p>
<p> an untended bath rains into the basement. </p>
<p> They must be the defacement they have made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The simmering acres swallow them. </p>
<p> Now, they never tire, fitted </p>
<p> in their spiritual attire: couches lit on fire, </p>
<p> forever unconsumed&mdash;the rhetoric of a liar </p>
<p> in every flare &amp; hiss. How they go on! They </p>
<p> shout, shout, for the argument to continue, </p>
<p> without doubt that it shall continue, as it shall. </p>
<p> Continue. Continue. They&rsquo;ll allow nothing. </p>
<p> They&rsquo;ll see it through, as they did on earth. </p>
<p> They&rsquo;ll not concede. They <em>insist.</em> Like this, </p>
<p>like <em>this.</em></p>
