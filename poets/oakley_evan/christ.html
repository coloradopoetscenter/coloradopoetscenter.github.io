<h1> Tattooist for Christ </h1>
<p> She had a hard demeanor, but as she </p>
<p> said, she had given herself to God. Green </p>
<p> crosses were around her wrists like stitches. </p>
<p> Sketches of jungle vistas, where serene </p>
<p> messiahs stood, taming the beasts with their </p>
<p> divinity, were everywhere. I guessed </p>
<p> these were the things she had faith in. Where </p>
<p> she went, these went before. The weightiest </p>
<p> of charms. Moving slowly about her task </p>
<p> now, another crazy gentled by the yoke </p>
<p> of failure and grief. When I left, she asked, </p>
<p><em> Do you believe?</em> The one of whom she spoke, </p>
<p> in that gallery of hearts, daggers, skulls, </p>
<p> seemed near. I thought that which annuls </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> fear, any power that balms affliction, </p>
<p> is power. But I didn&rsquo;t want her attention. </p>
<p> I looked around at slogans of perdition, </p>
<p> the spiritual cartoons, the pretensions </p>
<p> of flames, roses, crucifixes, snakes, doves, </p>
<p> the whole plethora of delinquent loves, </p>
<p> I listened to the broken fan stirring </p>
<p> the sketches, incense sweetening the whirring </p>
<p> needle, and I answered her the way one </p>
<p> answers an aged, born-again harridan: </p>
<p> I purchased a t-shirt. It showed the blood </p>
<p> on the martyred god she was the child of. </p>
<p> Its supernal Harley rising beside </p>
<p>the words:<em> He Died So That I Can Ride</em>.</p>
