        <h1><em>Icarus</em></h1>
        <p>Given the sky at last, he  can escape all thought: <br />
        the soulless calculations  his father scratched in sand, <br />
        models with wings pasted  to rats, the amputated <br />
        birds who crashed again  and again. <br />
                                                                                        And  yet, <br />
        Daedalus kissed the boy  before they lofted off, <br />
        father leading the way.  Their fast footprints abruptly ended <br />
        on the edge of the beach,  their very nature erased <br />
        as they capped the trees. <br />
                                                                        The  boy&rsquo;s wings pressed <br />
        like feet on a stair. He  was spirit; bones now hollow, <br />
        anger wisped away. An  obscene ardor pulsed  <br />
        with each wing beat.  Higher and higher, surpassing even <br />
        the father, who looked  below and behind <br />
        but never above for his  son. <br />
                                                                        Icarus  soared <br />
        and when last he looked,  Daedalus was no more <br />
        than a prone man  curiously flapping. Just let him try <br />
        to follow me. And with  that, the first feather <br />
        fell, grazing the neck of  the old man. Then <br />
        the barbules unwove, reed  bones broke, mist <br />
        loomed to meet him. <br />
                                                        Nobody floated. <br />
        What an awful burden our  salt blood makes. <br />
        Icarus spirals round the  hapless Daedalus. <br />
        In a cold blur the boy  overtook his father <br />
        moving on with short  shrugs. <br />
        He could have been  crying.</p>
