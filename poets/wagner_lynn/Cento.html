        <h1>Cento of / for Jake Adam York</h1>
        <p>You can tell yourself  it&rsquo;s just a dream,<br />
        knowing somehow / he  would be coming.<br />
        Trees burn quietly in the  morning sun.<br />
        It&rsquo;s almost painful, this  saturation<br />
        when the light begins to  fold into the leaves<br />
        and the forest means you  are alone.</p>
        <p>Names whisper from the  sheen<br />
        till the righteous sounds  emerge.<br />
        And now the least of  Shakespeare&rsquo;s birds,<br />
        their blues insistent,  entrancing,<br />
        will catch you, will say:<br />
        Tell me now, City of  Embrace . . .</p>
        <p>So much else is gone –<br />
        That man was as white as  I am, white as cotton.<br />
        He keeps saying their  recurring sentences, what he hears <br />
        in the whisper songs at  the lips of his ears.<br />
        And you know that music,<br />
        but you can&rsquo;t hear a  thing.</p>
        <p>Somewhere there is a name  for this,<br />
        and someone is weeping on  the Tallahatchie&rsquo;s bank.<br />
        And this is how they bury  you.<br />
        Strain your voice above  the crickets<br />
        as if that call might end  some other way.<br />
        And the flickers offer  only a syllable—</p>
        <p>and one memory will look  like another,<br />
        hard and white as bone.<br />
        When the trees begin to  hush<br />
        there are no answers / there  is no one to ask.<br />
        What&rsquo;s locked, what&rsquo;s  wound will open. <br />
        And so the elegy, the  mourning song.</p>
        <p>Someone could write it  down,<br />
        the afterward of that  last reflection.<br />
        The finger is gone that  pointed the way.<br />
        We do not look back.<br />
        The music never stops,<br />
        never really goes away.</p>
