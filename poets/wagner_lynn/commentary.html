        <p>In <em>No Blues This Raucous Song</em>, the  language is as fresh and 
          succulent as a cut pear. Wagner&rsquo;s work is full of joy. It is also 
          full of soulfulness and sorrow, but these are packed into 
          lines of such delicacy and tautness that even woe sings like a 
          plucked string. As I was reading, I realized that I was in the 
          presence of a small classic. 
  —Lynn Emanuel  </p>
        <p>Lynn Wagner&rsquo;s poems  deftly honor our unruly impulses. She 
          has a marvelous ear for rhythmic urgencies of the  American 
          tongue and a wicked wit. No word goes unnoticed on her 
          shrewd yet passionate watch.

        <p>I don&rsquo;t usually  fall in love with a book before I&rsquo;ve even opened its cover. But it just  happened with Lynn Wagner&rsquo;s chapbook,&nbsp;No Blues This Raucous Song.&nbsp;-Sara  C. Rauch review in NewPages.com</p>
        <p>Wagner&rsquo;s use of  language is a heady mix of the blues rhythms she reveres and reverberates to,  and a lonely formality that puts her in a fishing boat with Elizabeth Bishop  drinking, or invoking Emily Dickinson in the heat of her hellish room where the  &ldquo;the keys clacked ceaselessly all night long.&rdquo; - Deborah Bogen review on  Poemeleon</p>
