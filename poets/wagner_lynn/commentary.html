<p>In <em>No Blues This Raucous Song</em>, the  language is as fresh andsucculent as a cut pear. Wagner&rsquo;s work is full of joy. It is alsofull of soulfulness and sorrow, but these are packed intolines of such delicacy and tautness that even woe sings like aplucked string. As I was reading, I realized that I was in thepresence of a small classic. —Lynn Emanuel  </p><p>Lynn Wagner&rsquo;s poems  deftly honor our unruly impulses. Shehas a marvelous ear for rhythmic urgencies of the  Americantongue and a wicked wit. No word goes unnoticed on hershrewd yet passionate watch. —Baron Wormser</p><p>I don&rsquo;t usually  fall in love with a book before I&rsquo;ve even opened its cover. But it just  happened with Lynn Wagner&rsquo;s chapbook,&nbsp;No Blues This Raucous Song.&nbsp;-Sara  C. Rauch review in NewPages.com</p><p>Wagner&rsquo;s use of  language is a heady mix of the blues rhythms she reveres and reverberates to,  and a lonely formality that puts her in a fishing boat with Elizabeth Bishop  drinking, or invoking Emily Dickinson in the heat of her hellish room where the  &ldquo;the keys clacked ceaselessly all night long.&rdquo; - Deborah Bogen review on  Poemeleon</p>
