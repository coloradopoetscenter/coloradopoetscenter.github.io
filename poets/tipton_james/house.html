              <h1>All I Know is that I Built this House</h1>
              <p>All I know is that I built this house<br />
                in order to dream, and it only happened<br />
                after years of gathering, pocket by pocket,<br />
                a little earth here and there until <br />
                I had enough at last to put a house upon <br />
                and some earth still left to fill the heart <br />
          when dawn came knocking at the door.</p>
              <p>I built this house with sea and desert canyons,<br />
                with the words of ordinary people,<br />
                with autumns without money,<br />
                with hands dusted with dark flour,<br />
                with old hats and rain and honey,<br />
          and with the sturdy smiles of the poor.</p>
              <p>I built this house with the fragrances<br />
                of all the women I have ever loved,<br />
                and while I was working high in the air,<br />
                I remembered how they arrived,<br />
                one by one, in secret, offering me<br />
          wine bottles filled with rosy poems.</p>
              <p>I think now that I can entertain gypsies<br />
                and peasants and set up a mail box<br />
                that receives only poems, and I can<br />
                have pot lucks for indomitable poets<br />
                and closet saints; and be sure to bring<br />
                a singing casserole, and wear shoes<br />
          that can leap out of the world.</p>
              <p> --James Tipton</p>
