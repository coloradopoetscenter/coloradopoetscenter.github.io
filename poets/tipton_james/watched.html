              <h1>I Watched at Low Tide Your Breasts Rise</h1>
              <p>I watched at low tide your breasts rise.<br />
                I watched every effort that your made<br />
                to be beautiful, for me. Even though<br />
                I was a stranger, your body moved<br />
                for me alone, like the hope<br />
                that moved behind the mirror<br />
          that did not find you beautiful at all.</p>
              <p>What a strange thing, that longing<br />
                to be beautiful, the sweet pretense <br />
                and secret weeping, the doubt inside<br />
                that rose against the right you had<br />
                to boldly wear that pink bikini<br />
                and walk alone on what you thought<br />
          was sand deserted.</p>
              <p>At what age did you know&mdash;<br />
                for certain&mdash;that you<br />
                never would be beautiful,<br />
                never shine yourself<br />
                into the poems of lovers,<br />
                never have the sultry bliss<br />
          that beauty by itself can bring.</p>
              <p>I took you home in thought<br />
                that moment by the sea,<br />
                and lived a life with you,<br />
                you homely face casting its desire<br />
                each winter night by candle, <br />
                your body arched<br />
          in clumsy grace and love.</p>
              <p>But I did not tell you this.<br />
                I did not speak at all, <br />
                pondering your sweet attempts<br />
                to bend and search for shells, <br />
                to move with all the sensual delight<br />
                your awkward dreams<br />
          could teach you.</p>
              <p>Now, months later, this autumn night<br />
                in Colorado, I write this awkward <br />
                poem for you&mdash;some clumsy art<br />
                I struggle with&mdash;because <br />
                that longing in you<br />
                was so beautiful and pure<br />
          it touched this tired heart.</p>
              <p> --James Tipton</p>
