<h1>Some Days I Wake Up Walking Over the Desert</h1>
<p>Some days I wake up walking over the desert<br />and see pieces of me everywhere:<br />in these knuckles of ancient trees,<br />in that tumbleweed of soul in this spring wing,<br />in the tiny flowers rooted on heart rock;<br />even a piece of sleep that I thought was mine flew<br />  in the blue wing of day out of a dead limb.</p>
<p>Ah, this gathering and gathering of self,<br />this brown joy in the eyes of a beloved dog,<br />this dust that dances into blossom,<br />this little notebook that is the earth,<br />this endless love that when we least expect it<br />knocks on our day and says:<br />  let the day begin.</p>
<p>Insisting with the only life I know<br />on some peace at the end of solitude <br />and desperation, I have arrived <br />here, at this desert place,<br />where a magic that few would want<br />rings light around me, where grace<br />  comes toward me, one step at a time.</p>
<p> --James Tipton</p>
