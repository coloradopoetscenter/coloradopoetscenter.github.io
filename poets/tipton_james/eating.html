title: James Tipton : Eating the World

<h1>Eating the World</h1>
<p>I was born with my mouth open...<br />entering this juicy world <br />of peaches and lemons and ripe sun <br />and the pink and secret flesh of women,<br />this world where dinner is in the breath<br />of the subtle desert, <br />in the spices of the distant sea<br />  which late at night drift over sleep.</p>
<p>I was born somewhere between <br />the brain and the pomegranate,<br />with a tongue tasting the delicious textures <br />of hair and hands and eyes; <br />I was born out of the heart stew, <br />out of the infinite bed, to walk upon <br />  this infinite earth.</p>
<p>I want to feed you the flowers of ice<br />on this winter window, <br />the aromas of many soups,<br />the scent of sacred candles <br />that follows me around this cedar house, <br />I want to feed you the lavender <br />that lifts up out of certain poems, <br />and the cinnamon of apples baking, <br />and the simple joy we see<br />in the sky when we fall in love.<br /><br />I want to feed you the pungent soil <br />where I harvested garlic,<br />I want to feed you the memories <br />rising out of the aspen logs<br />when I split them, and the pinyon smoke <br />that gathers around the house on a still night, <br />  and the mums left by the kitchen door.</p>
<p>I want to feed you the colors of rain <br />on deserted parking lots,<br />and the folds of delirious patchouli <br />in the Indian skirt of the woman<br />on Market Street in San Francisco,<br />and the human incense of so much devotion<br />  in tiny villages in Colorado and Peru.</p>
<p>I want to serve you breakfast at dawn,<br />I want to serve you the bread <br />that rises in the desert dust, serve you <br />the wind that wanders through the canyons,<br />serve you the stars that fall over the bed,<br />serve you the Hopi corn one thousand years old, <br />serve you the saffron in the western sunset,<br />serve you the delicate pollen that blows its lullaby <br />through each lonely wing of flesh;<br />I want to serve you the low hum of bees<br />clustered together all winter<br />  eating their honey.</p>
