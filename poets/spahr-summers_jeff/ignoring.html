<h1>Ignoring History</h1>
<p>We choose to do this<br />as a society<br />as a race<br />we clamber for bread<br />and circuses like Romans<br />already corrupted<br />lounging in our spas<br />barking orders<br />throwing undesirables<br />to the lions because<br />we don't really know why<br />but we do it anyway<br />we live for it somehow<br />it comforts us<br />to wield this power<br />like crafty would be gods<br />creating chance<br />and circumstances<br />handing out candy<br />  lording over life and death</p>
