              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Watching Daddy Die, by Jeffrey  Spahr-Summers, is hauntingly moving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ironically, this poem is not about watching daddy die, but about the&nbsp; speaker's inability to do so.&nbsp; The poem begins with a distanced description:  &quot;Something weighs heavy on the man/Lulled to sleep deep in the  recliner.&quot; And the speaker, who lives several states away from his  parents, is inquisitive, calm: &quot;something makes me wonder/Why death deals  a winning hand/Then shouts foul play across the table.&quot;&nbsp; But the poem moves quickly to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the personal and takes an emotional  turn:&nbsp; &quot;But who is the old man  silent behind me.&quot;&nbsp; Following lines  prepare the reader for the poems well-achieved ending: &quot;I'm afraid to  watch mama cry,/I'm not strong enough to watch daddy die.&quot;<br />

              <p>&quot;Poetry  Victims, now there's a catchy name.&nbsp; Who  among us has not been victimized by poetry-be it by the pen and tear-streaked  stationary of a heartbroken ex who can't take a hint or the unfeeling editor  who callously rejected your latest poetic offering, we have all felt the sting  of poetry.&nbsp; How could I not sign up for  The Poetry Victim's daily e-mail?</p>
              <p> And that's  how I met Jeffrey Spahr-Summers, a.k.a. ZZ Baggins, the mysterious and oh-so  dependable creator of The Poetry Victims. The mode is set, The music is  provided ... all we have to do is follow along and enjoy.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                We live in  uncertain times, but if there is one thing we are able to rely on, Dan Rather  no longer a given, it is that The Poetry Victims will appear unfailingly in our  mailboxes-no matter what.&nbsp; We've sat with  Jeffrey through his father's passing and through the subsequent cremation.&nbsp; We've cried with him-his loss was ours; I  felt his pain keenly standing guard now over my own father during what are his  final days.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
          Jeffrey  Spahr-Summers is a constant-and I take comfort in knowing that.&quot;</p>
