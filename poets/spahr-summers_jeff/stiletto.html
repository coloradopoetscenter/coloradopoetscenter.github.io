<h1>Stiletto</h1>
<p>I love to swim<br />with blossoms in the stream<br />air alive with sunlight<br />and drink the tale of years.<br />I would tell you, dear beloved...<br />I grew, before time was worth mine,<br />alone<br />  with the sun to soothe my feet.</p>
<p>I travelled<br />country through country<br />sea upon sea.<br />In a land where daylight<br />is shadowed with dragons and kings,<br />blood and bone,<br />I built a fortress<br />stone upon stone,<br />  and built myself in.</p>
<p>(from Fear of Heights, 1984)</p>
