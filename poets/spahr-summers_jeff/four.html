<h1>Four-fifteen a.m.</h1>
<p>I am preparing chicken salad<br />and white meat cools<br />in the colander<br />in the pocket of the sink<br />I am cutting grapes<br />in half<br />another act of love<br />in the den<br />just off the kitchen<br />I sit with an orange bowl<br />in my lap a bowl<br />of screaming half grapes<br />such panic<br />I have never seen before<br />I have never<br />witnessed this before so<br />I coo to them<br />my little green sacrifices<br />my offerings<br />I coo to them like<br />I do to babies<br />and I think about<br />  the women in my life</p>
