<h1>reasons for raisins</h1>
<p>1) digging for seeds we<br />kneel on the ground little weasels<br />scratching in the dirt<br />so we dig and dig<br />we dig until we hurt<br />until we are tired and thirsty<br />and require rest we<br />drink wine and our son<br />eats raisins a fist<br />full at a time<br />and we dig and dig so long<br />and it goes on<br />and on<br />and on<br />  until nothing escapes us</p>
<p>2) we are at odds<br />with how to do this we<br />so nearly beg for<br />a storm to come crashing<br />through our lives<br />we are calling for rain<br />to save us the need<br />to pace and stomp or throw<br />our hands up to the sky<br />so we think on how a<br />dance might do it<br />or maybe a riddle<br />or a poem<br />or a song<br />or maybe just a little<br />  of them all</p>
<p>3) you dont actually see<br />the vines growing<br />  they grow very slow</p>
<p>4) we know to let them do this<br />they know to make us wait</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) she likes the sweet ones just<br />the very green ones without seeds<br />the ones that pop in your teeth<br />like cherry tomatoes spraying<br />across the inside of your mouth<br />these are the ones she<br />wants and so do i and<br />our son also likes them sweet<br />but small so we give him<br />all the small ones<br />and secretly we are amazed<br />or maybe more disturbed really<br />how quickly they disappear<br />one after another<br />some for her<br />some for me but<br />mostly for him we<br />  divide them so well</p>
<p>6) tell me you know something<br />of the love lost on grapes<br />of skin peeled away<br />very carefully<br />and while eating the grapes<br />skinned and exposed<br />for what they really are<br />think of those of us who crave them<br />who want only to eat them<br />again<br />and again<br />and again<br />who want only to hold them<br />to save them for another day<br />to do the very human<br />thing and change them<br />  into raisins or wine</p>
<p>7) call it age if you like<br />or experience or maturity<br />just as wine matures with age<br />or call it a step in the cycle<br />through which all living<br />things must pass<br />in order to survive as<br />humans we believe<br />in the pleasures of life<br />this is why we eat grapes<br />or drink wine<br />or plant such seeds<br />and as humans we ultimately<br />mature so as to provide for<br />ourselves and the ones we love<br />this is why we must grow old<br />  so it is also with grapes</p>
<p>8) collecting them<br />was the hard part they<br />came down on us like hail<br />it went on<br />and on<br />for days we wondered<br />where would it end<br />and we collected them<br />in whatever we could find<br />instantly out of bowls<br />pots and pans<br />we knew we could<br />  not keep them all</p>
<p>9) here is the first raisin<br />the sweet one<br />to some the one<br />most likely to dissolve<br />in your mouth or your hand<br />or afford such devotion<br />the one with thick skin that is<br />frustrating and hard to penetrate<br />the one that cracks and<br />is brittle like glass<br />this is the one<br />  that becomes bitter</p>
<p>10) this is the raisin that<br />while bathing becomes plump<br />as a young grape again<br />the one most certain<br />to satisfy a thirst or hunger<br />or something you cant<br />quite place like desire<br />the one so pumped full of life and<br />a need for more than is here<br />here is the one<br />  that must go</p>
<p>11) and here is the smallest of all<br />the child grape<br />unripe and undone<br />the sweet one<br />the i dont want to go<br />and please<br />dont leave me grape<br />  i will be as you are</p>
<p>12) better than thirteen<br />are twelve<br />each a story<br />little secrets of a child<br />each a dream<br />  better things to come</p>
<p>13) here are the ones<br />that got away the ones<br />so cocksure and cool the ones<br />who ran so electric<br />as they slipped under the<br />stove the refrigerator and the sink<br />how sad they all seem now<br />  cloistered in the corner dust</p>
<p>14) we place it on the table<br />the last one and<br />we gather around to stare<br />we are dogs licking our lips<br />but we dont dare<br />eat it or split it<br />three ways afraid<br />each of us in our own way to<br />  be through with the thing</p>
<p>15) empty boxes<br />what happens now<br />  is they become one another</p>
<p>16) god<br />protect these seeds<br />keep them healthy watered<br />and warm<br />allow them space to run<br />let them multiply<br />spread their species<br />  far and wide</p>
