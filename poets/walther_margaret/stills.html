  <h1>Stills/ Steals </h1>  <p>Chrome green, shriek yellow, these pills, so  appropriate.  Bottled <br />  sunshine, they’re called.I’m back to back with Prozac—wonder-woman </p>  <p>drug.  <em>So we have an agreement? </em> <em>No</em>,  I mumbled, but she hurtled<br /> off the prescription anyway.Enjoy.  The devil’s numbing</p>  <p>needles.  I’ve been on  this flimflam jaunt before—ends in<br /> a cul-de-sac/ slash attic, poet tongue-tied, contemplating</p>  <p>noose.  <em>I’m not taking these anymore</em>, I announce  next session, and she<br /> looks at me as if, unruly child.  Psych-doctor drearie, I am sixty</p>  <p>and have now become no one’s child.  She flappers on—<br /> <em>adjust the dosage, try  another anti-d.  </em>I say,<em> Exercise, meditation</em></p>  <p>and watch her lower lip curl.  <em>You  need something</em>—insert your own<br /> word here—<em>lovey,  ducky, pumpkin, sweetie pie</em>.  I run  from her office</p>  <p>to my car, roll down the windows, exhale.  <em>Let me  feel—highs, lows</em><br /> <em>any blessed any of  anything.  Even that old cut loose  trapeze/ slash trapeze</em></p>  <p><em>abyss.  O unkempt clown heart—come back home.  How I miss flambé-</em><br /> <em>red lipstick,  black-kohled eyes, the whole shit-shebanging cabaret</em>.</p>  <p>(Originally  published by <em>Many Mountains Moving</em> –  Won their 2009 Poetry Prize)</p>
