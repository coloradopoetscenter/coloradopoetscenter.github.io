  <h1>Ode to the Oboe </h1>  <p>wanderer of the horizon, gypsy, you beckon me, haunting as  the cry of the night train, its</p><p> echo in the distance </p>  <blockquote> <p>
pilgrim, take me with you—</p> <blockquote>
<p>traipsing through  endless city streets, bazaars, vagabond looking <br />for the mandalas  of woven rugs, the eyes in copper kettles</p>
<p>folk toys, cows  with blue flanks, crimson hooves chassé and bow <br />before they  disappear into a satiny orange barn</p>
<p>scarves—chartreuse,  electric lemon, magenta—stream from <br />the sleeves of  discarded theater costumes</p> </blockquote>  </blockquote>
<p>prophet, impersonator intoning the wilderness, you scroll  apocrypha—spindrift <br />stars—into the labyrinth of my ear</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>  <p> jaguar sprints,  chameleons zigzag branches, sepia on sepia, one <br /> lone duck  traverses the river, seeking a mate</p>  <p>peonies,  porcelain white, tremble, their throats hoarse from trying <br /> to sing to a world  of sleepers</p>  <p>notes reverberate,  waves in a shell, for you are the joker, the court <br /> jester, forever  mimicking yourself</p>  </blockquote><p>cross-dresser  of the dark neck, enter—</p><blockquote>  <blockquote> <blockquote><blockquote>  <p> let me hear you—</p></blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>wistful chanteuse, wanting to belong, born to play alone,  sojourner endlessly searching for the chaste carnival, the Mardi Gras that  hawks the holy grail</p>  <p>(Originally  published by <em>In Posse Review</em>.  Was selected by Web del Sol in 2010 for its <em>e-SCENE best of the Literary Journals</em>.)</p>
