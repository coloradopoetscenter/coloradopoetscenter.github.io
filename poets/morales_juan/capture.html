<h1>On Juan's Capture of Se&ntilde;ora Chonita</h1>
<p><em>1897</em></p>
<p>In a dirt-drawn circle, Juan waits<br />
for nightfall.&nbsp; The old people say<br />
boys and men, blessed with the name Juan,<br />
hold the power to catch witches.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
To trap Se&ntilde;ora Chonita, he wears<br />
an inside-out shirt like superstitious travelers<br />
afraid of her curses.&nbsp; While he scratches<br />
his neck red, eyes adjusting to dusk, <br />
<br />
a coyote noses into the plaza,<br />
the way witches become orbs of light<br />
wandering between villages.</p>
<p>The coyote sees him, sniffs the air,<br />enters the circle.&nbsp; Juan yells, <em>&iexcl;Venga, bruja!</em><br />The coyote panics and shakes, fur melting<br />to cold naked skin. She crouches,<br /><br />squints at him. Juan never stops fearing<br />Se&ntilde;ora Chonita even when townspeople,<br />clutching torches and bullied prayers, loom<br /><br />over her just before they kill her.&nbsp;  Forever after<br />Juan is trapped, like a witch in a circle,<br />afraid of feeling the grip of clawed hands<br />  dragging him into the desert.</p>
