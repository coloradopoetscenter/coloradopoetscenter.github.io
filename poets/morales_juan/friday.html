<h1>Friday and the Year that Followed</h1>
<p><em>Ambato, Ecuador, 1949</em></p>
<p>We never saw him before that Friday.<br />I was ten when the hollowed man<br />came to our house.&nbsp; He was tall, <br /><br />dark-skinned, but not like los ind&iacute;genas, <br />who sold crafts on the street, <br />washed clothes in the withering river.<br /><br />Mam&aacute; eased against the wood door, eager<br />to make him go.&nbsp; His shadow turned, <br />looked at me.&nbsp; He stared past her as if  he entered.<br />I felt the man everywhere: he creeped<br /><br />up the leg of the kitchen table, <br />stood in corners, and brushed past us<br />light as breath we blew on hot soup. <br /><br />My tingling skin, hairs on my neck told me<br />this year would hold my eyes open.&nbsp; Mam&aacute;  kissed<br />my forehead, told me to pray,<br /><br /><em>For the man with no  blood came for you.<br /></em>Sunrays faded, became slivers.<br />The mountains and town grew cold as rings<br />  left on the table from the soup.</p>
<p>When everyone went to bed, <br />all the lights snuffed, creaking floors halted, <br />and I knew the tall man was there.<br /><br />He walked through rooms, eating sleep<br />from my body, and touched our belongings,<br />  like the other ghosts lost in Ambato.</p>
