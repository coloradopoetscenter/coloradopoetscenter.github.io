              <p> From Ecuador to Puerto Rico to Vietnam and some points in between, this   collection covers a great deal of space and time.&nbsp; The language is alive and the   subjects of genuine interest&mdash;an earthquake and its aftermath, folklore and folk   wisdom, and the life of a soldier&hellip;.In the first section of the book we're shown   the devastation of an earthquake along with the kind of magic one associates   with <em>One Hundred Years of </em>Solitude&mdash;mystical healing, capturing witches,   curing imbecility.&nbsp; We also get views of the specific Latino culture.&nbsp; Such   things seem exotic initially but they are delivered with directness and great   clarity to the reader.&nbsp; Throughout the collection there is striking imagery and   a concrete use of detail and the language is vigorous, especially in its use of   lively and appropriate verbs.&nbsp; There are many poems here which are important   contributions to the culture.&nbsp;</p>

              <p> From a mine sweeper in Vietnam, to a guard at Spandau prison; from the   devastation of an earthquake in Ecuador, to witchcraft in colonial New Mexico,   the poems in this ambitious first collection span time and place.&nbsp; Powerful   individually, it is when read all together that these poems, like the Nazca   lines, really take form,&nbsp;creating a sweeping vista of poetic vision and   beauty.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&mdash;Lisa Ch&aacute;vez</p>
              <p> In his remarkable first collection, Juan Morales dons with great   enthusiasm and versatility the cloak of the muralist, fittingly painting history   into myth, news into legend.&nbsp; Amid these stories of witches, superstitions,   earthquakes, war, jokes, and ghosts, Morales makes good on his word to push &quot;the   doors of heaven open,&quot; constructing a kind of musical simultaneity that unites   the world of past, of present, of prophetic. Whatever magic we readers encounter   in<em> Friday and the Year that Followed</em> is real, if only that it awakens us   to a nearly ungraspable truth: our miraculous is-ness.</p>

              <p>Juan J. Morales writes: &ldquo;It takes a thousand voices to tell a single story,&rdquo; which is another way of saying, &ldquo;It took a thousand journeys to get to mine.&rdquo; As an artist with Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican bloodlines engaged with the Spanish colonial histories of South America and the Caribbean, Morales explores the legacies of language and landscape, mapping out an expansive poetic portrait of his ancestral homeland. <em>The Siren World </em>is a glorious testimony to the will of the Americas to reconfigure and preserve its cultural identities, which are still thriving and palpable in the heartbeats and &ldquo;reconstruction songs&rdquo; of its native children, its travelers, its bordercrossers, and its poets.</p>
              <p><em>—</em>Rigoberto González</p>
              <p>In <em>The Siren World, </em>Juan J. Morales explores the complexities of identity with grace and humor, passion and irony, arcing across centuries through lessons never learned, voices never heard. Caught between multiple worlds, multiple identities both mistaken and claimed, he offers a unique perspective that challenges many of our assumptions as readers. He may be someone &ldquo;who speaks the native tongue&rdquo; he&rsquo;s &ldquo;never learned,&rdquo; but he is fluent in the language of poetry. History does indeed come alive in these poems that remind us that we are still living it, and reliving it, moving back, forward, then back again, no matter who we are—and, as Morales reminds us, we&rsquo;re all still trying to figure that out too.</p>

              <p>—Jim Daniels</p>
              <p>The word &quot;cleave&quot; has two seemingly paradoxical meanings: to divide, and to join. In The Siren World, Juan Morales defines a series of distances--from Ecuador to Puerto Rico, from mother to father, from the historical pain of a smallpox victim to the &quot;failed double-kick flip, ankle's loud pop&quot; of a skateboarding accident. On one page, Pizarro and his generals sort the &quot;wreckage of job well done,&quot; and on the next we confront &quot;The Cursing Chorus of the Mob.&quot; But these poems are about bridges, not canyons; they do not gape, they reach. They sing, and they code switch, as in &quot;Passport&quot;: &quot;When I turned 18, my father gave me a machete. When I turned 21, my father gave me a shoe shine kit.&quot; Morales showcases his striking dexterity of craft, toggling between prose poetry and sonnets, and a genuine search for truth no matter how painful. Yet there is pleasure here too, in the euphoria of the moment &quot;When ancestral light circles you and seizes your pen.&quot; I am grateful for this voice, and for this brave and bracing collection. </p>
