<h1>Minesweep on Highway 13 Near Lai Key</h1>
<p>1968</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inch by inch, the  minesweeper checks the road,</p>
<p class="indent">listening with his feet</p>
<p class="indent2">placing his heel then toe  down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent">When his detector gleans a claymore, </p><p>it  hisses, heavies his grip.</p><p class="indent">He stops us by holding up his hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent2">The Captain tells us to stay  off the road.</p><p class="indent">We look outward into the trees</p><p>and  columns of yellow grass.&nbsp; Sometimes, we glance  down</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent">the road at tank tracks, fresh holes</p><p class="indent2">behind us, claymores he already  found.</p><p class="indent">And everything still feels lucky</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>when  he pinpoints the spot.</p><p class="indent">He sets down the detector and kneels; the headphones</p><p class="indent2">droop over his helmet, static  and clicks in ears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent">We stiffen up when he pulls out his knife</p><p>drags  lines around the mine.</p><p class="indent">The minesweeper works the blade like he was blind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent2">He looks away, and feels  blade skimming the sides</p><p class="indent">and draw a circle. Metal clinks metal; he moves</p><p>the  knife under the mine where dirt resumes. As he lifts</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent">the claymore, no one sees the grenade underneath.</p><p class="indent2">He disappears into a rain of  dirt. </p><p class="indent">We duck instinctively. &nbsp;Hands cover faces</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>as dirt and debris falls in a cruel hush.&nbsp;  That quiet</p><p class="indent">that comes after echoes the blast.&nbsp; Nobody</p><p class="indent2">
ever finds a trace of the  minesweeper.</p><p class="indent2">&nbsp;</p><p>Every  day afterward knocks us down</p><p class="indent">like every cigarette smoked and smashed under our  boots.</p><p class="indent2">We hold every bite of food</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="indent">and bit of water we swallow,</p>
<p>bitterly holding onto the  shame of being alive.</p>
