            <h1>DMC Time</h1>
            <p>After doing some sampling yesterday, I decided to use 824, a peppy medium blue.</p>
            <p>But my coffee had cooled.</p>
            <p>So I went to the kitchen to heat it up and punched in, not the 1-0-0 I usually do, but 8-2-4.</p>
            <p>Ah well, that&rsquo;s what comes from living with your colors, in your colors, by your colors.</p>
            <p>I was born on 517, a fine spring cerulean, and my favorite red is the shank of the evening, 817.</p>
            <p>A good day for drying, I said to myself last week. I&rsquo;d just come in from hanging out the wash, and the microwave clock read 743, a bright sunny yellow.</p>
            <p>902 is bedtime for me, a darkling shade of red, and I rise at 600, a zingy fuchsia.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I could go on here, counting out my days according to the colors that I use, but I do so anyway,</p>
            <p>stitching almost every afternoon and evening, making of my floss dreams and approximations of reality that connect me to a network of embroiderers all around the world,</p>
            <p>one vast canvas of colorful achievement&mdash;</p>
            <p>stitch by stitch by shining stitch.</p>
