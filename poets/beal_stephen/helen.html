<h1>What Helen Nelson Did</h1>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>She read Anne Tyler faithfully. And <em>People</em>&mdash;but only when she was getting her hair done.</p>
<p>She bought casual clothes at Bergdorf&rsquo;s, on the second floor, suits and evening wear from designers and boutiques.</p>
<p>She had her body tended to&mdash;hair, nails, massage, tucks here and there, an unsightly mole removed.</p>
<p>When Jack died she sold the Westchester house and moved to Sutton Place. <br />A two-bedroom; nothing really grand.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t miss driving, she loved taking cabs and trains, private cars when she thought the trains would be crowded.</p>
<p>She lived well and she enjoyed her life, traveling in spring and fall, summering on Fisher&rsquo;s Island, loving her family and being loved by them&mdash;</p>
<p>although, as one daughter-in-law put it, almost any woman of Helen&rsquo;s class and station would have served as well as she.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Helen laughed when the remark came back to her, and she repeated it to several friends who also laughed.</p>
<p>But the remark festered over time. It got after her. Diana was the smartest of Helen&rsquo;s three daughters-in-law, the least conventional, and Helen kept resisting the urge not to leave Diana the promised pearls. She could leave Diana the wizzly garnet earrings. The chipped topaz ring. Great-grandmother&rsquo;s jet bracelet.</p>
<p>But no, Helen would not get anywhere being mean and vengeful. However, <br />she wasn&rsquo;t getting anywhere trying not to act like her friends. Her classmates at Smith. The women with whom she&rsquo;d entered the Junior League.</p>
<p>What on earth could a woman of her class and station do to change? To show that she had changed? To distinguish herself from the herd? And still be tasteful?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As it turned out, tasteful had to go. Insofar as Sutton Place was concerned. And Fisher&rsquo;s Island.</p>
<p>Helen took up yodeling. Rather, she went back to yodeling, way far back, all the way to grammar school in Canton, Ohio, where little Helen&rsquo;s yodeling brought down the house every spring.</p>
<p>It just happened, it was something she did in the backyard one day, and her father liked it so she kept it up until she got really good, until she could </p>
<p>yodel &ldquo;Lady of Spain&rdquo; and the first movement of Tchiakowsky&rsquo;s piano concerto and &ldquo;Take Me Out to the Ballgame,&rdquo; always the finale of the James A. Garfield School spring pageant.</p>
<p>Then Helen hit puberty, became beautiful and acquired the desire to be tasteful, whereupon the rest of her life took over.</p>
<p>And, as she looked back on it later, almost wiped her out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>She had always looked younger than she was. With a few more tucks and adjustments, plus a lot of great makeup, she contrived to look fifty.</p>
<p>Her career took off.</p>
<p>An appearance in a country show at the 92 nd Street Y led to a gig with a band in the Village. Springsteen caught the act and asked her to do backup on a new album. Then she opened for him in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>From there, as they say, the rest was history, mainly at The Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. In polka dots and red high heels.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>But you look like Daisy Mae! Diana cried when Helen showed her the outfit.</p>
<p>Diana! she responded. Thank you! Everyone says Helen Nelson is so stodgy. Daisy Mae Nelson! I&rsquo;ll yodel for years!</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Twenty years as it turned out, in whose progress the erstwhile Helen acquired <br />a Tennessee mansion much bigger than Graceland, a dark-haired husband younger than her youngest son, and a fondness for yams baked with honey <br />and pecans.</p>
<p>To Helen&rsquo;s delight, the yams wrecked Diana&rsquo;s bridgework one Thanksgiving, and Darlin&rsquo; Daisy Mae, as her tombstone read, apologized by leaving her favorite daughter-in-law not only her pearls but her diamond and opal tiara.</p>
<p>The latter was the ugliest thing Diana and Sam had ever seen, but it sold right away at Sotheby&rsquo;s, to a Russian tycoon whose daughter wore the tiara for her marriage to a Saudi prince.</p>
<p>At the reception, Daisy Mae&rsquo;s recorded yodels filled the gentle night in Bahrain.</p>
