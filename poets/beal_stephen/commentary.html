              <p>Colorado poet and artist Stephen Beal (1939-2010) was represented on this site and his information has been left up as testimonial to his life and work.  </p>

              <p>My favorite reaction is Annie Dillard&rsquo;s, used as a blurb on <em>The Very Stuff </em>back cover: &ldquo;Beal is charming . . . dedicated to his craft. He does good work.&rdquo; </p>
