<h1>Readings / Workshop Availability</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m always available for readings. I&rsquo;m a bit of a ham, and I like to have fun. I had throat cancer four years ago, and the radiation treatments have left my throat somewhat scratchy, so it&rsquo;s always good if there&rsquo;s another reader to spell me in case my voice needs a rest. As for teaching, it took me thirty years to get over my education and begin writing what I wanted to write the way it happened to come out. Rather prosey now; as of graduation from Williams in 1960 I could write a sonnet in thirty minutes, perfectly scanned, perfectly rhymed, perfectly vacuous. I think I can best help students by reading my work and explaining how I came to write it.</p>
