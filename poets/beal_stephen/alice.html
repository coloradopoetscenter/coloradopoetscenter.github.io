<p>Alice B. Toklas Confronts a Tea Bag</p>
<p><em> 27 Rue de Fleurus, 1948 </em></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Gertrude Stein would not approve.</p>
<p>Gertrude Stein is dead.</p>
<p>Gertrude Stein <em>does</em><em>not</em> approve.</p>
<p>You can not still Gertrude Stein. Alice B. Toklas knows that. Gertrude Stein lives on by the force of her words, and her words assert her disapproval.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A tea bag? says Gertrude Stein. Is that one word or two? No matter, says Gertrude Stein. <em>Tea bag</em> is a very unpleasant image. Take it away. Toute suite!</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Oh dear, says Alice B. Toklas as she regards what the Lipton Company has done.</p>
<p>Then she asks herself this question: Would Picasso use a tea bag?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Wearing a tea bag over each ear, Alice B. Toklas prepares her pot the conventional way.</p>
