  <h1>In Case of War</h1>  <p>In case of war, break glass. <br /> Gather the children.</p>  <p>Pour rice through their outstretched fingers into the fire. <br /> Conjure innocence,</p>  <p>the turtle&rsquo;s long swim, eggs buried where the tide <br /> brings broken toys.</p>  <p>In the mind&rsquo;s fixed eye, a caravan of arms chugs north <br /> through mushroom clouds</p>  <p>seared on the retinas of gray-haired children, <br /> born in a cold peace</p>  <p>under banners of war, the silks we use<br /> to wrap the fallen. </p>  <p>In case of war, bow low as the moon calls us<br /> by our childhood names.</p>  <p>The price of memory?<br /> A heart that keens.</p>  <p>In case of war, gather bones shattered like glass. <br /> And the children.</p>  <p>Pour rice through their open hands <br /> into the fire. </p>  <p>(<em>The Napkin Project</em> with artist Ellen Sollod: an anti-war mail art piece delivered to more than 50  world leaders and opinion shapers during the run-up to the war in Iraq.)</p>
