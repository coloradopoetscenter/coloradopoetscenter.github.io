<h1>Bibliography </h1> <p>An artist book is a piece of art created as a hand-built  book. It may use materials and forms perfected centuries ago, or introduce  surprising new forms and materials. Artist books push boundaries and honor the  place of books and ideas in our world. One-of-a-kind, or issued in very small  editions, they are purchased for private and public collections, exhibited and  traded by collectors.</p>  <h3><em>Tokyo Press Check: Making Face</em></h3>  <p>Held in the permanent collection of the Walker Art Center in  Minneapolis, and of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and in the private  collection of Robert J.
