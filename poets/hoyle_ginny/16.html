  <h1>I Was 16</h1>  <p>I  remember how you looked in your clean white strait jacket: <strong></strong><br /> a  90-pound finch, wings pinned useless at your sides.</p>  <p><em>House of rivers, house of reeds,  summer mornings voiced by redwings.</em></p>  <p>How we  hid the scissors, hid the knives, lied <br /> under  doctor&rsquo;s orders to fool your fiery mind.</p>  <p><em>House of suffocating summer heat.  House of sorrowful tides.</em></p>  <p>I  remember the sunny day they came for you, a trance of alibis, <br /> capture  construed as rescue.</p>  <p><em>Great Blue Heron stock still in  the water, yes</em></p>  <p>to save  you, <br /> we  betrayed you. </p>  <p><em>Eyes of the hunter, hunter eyes  trained on murky depths; life beneath the surface furtive, miraculous</em></p>  <p>how we  survived, like sticks hurled the way you taught us into the flood-gorged  stream, sinking under the stone bridge, popping up on the other side.</p>  <p><em>A glimmer world of ebb and flow; </em></p>  <p>until  the day I die, I will see your face as they forced you into the ambulance, </p>  <p><em> things no more, no less than they are:</em></p>  <p>and the  terror in your eyes. How we hid behind dark trees watching, steeped in our own  blank fear. And a long year in a beige house beside a tidal inlet, no outlet  for the pain,</p>  <p><em>just the mystery of other  creatures—breathing, feeding, somehow singing…</em></p>  <p>(<em>MARGIE</em>) </p>
