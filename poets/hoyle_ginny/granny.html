  <h1>Granny&rsquo;s Attic</h1>  <p> Up  a steep and narrow stair I climb, because the grownups <br /> are  napping, and that&rsquo;s where the books are. </p>  <p>Up  a narrow stair and at the top, I pause <br /> under  the eaves where silverfish scuttle. </p>  <p>Wood  planks creak under sneakered feet as I tiptoe past <br /> old  file cabinets and an exhausted swivel chair. </p>  <p>I&rsquo;m  in the inner sanctum now where the books live. <br /> I&rsquo;m  pretty sure I can I hear them breathe.</p>  <p>I  choose carefully, paying attention to ornamentation, <br /> the  color of covers (red is good) and the delicious oddness of words. </p>  <p>Slowly,  I fall into a world of outlandish splendors <br /> jumbled  together: the vast kingdom of Oz, </p>  <p>charted  by an ordinary girl, the Alhambra<br /> at  dusk and, in an odd blue book </p>  <p>with  small dark type, a world inhabited by a stern man <br /> and  his sorrowful wife who hides a secret in her belly;</p>  <p>something  about God, something about a devil. <br /> Does  anyone know I&rsquo;m up here? </p>  <p>And  then a book about a girl at the top of the world <br /> who  drinks goat&rsquo;s milk from a wooden bowl. </p>  <p>I  know I have stumbled on the secret garden, or<br /> the  cozy book-lined tower abandoned</p>  <p>by  Rapunzel and her lover and I wonder—why <br /> did  she let that man climb up her hair and take her away? </p>  <p>Downstairs,  a family turns the pages of boisterous lives. Up here,<br /> sun  slips through windowpanes. Rain rattles on the old slate roof</p>  <p>and  I know, I know, <br /> I  am never coming down.</p>  <p>(<em>Wazee Journal</em>)</p>
