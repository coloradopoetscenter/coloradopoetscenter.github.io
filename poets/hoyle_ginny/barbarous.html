          <h1>Barbarous World</h1>
          <p>If you  rise in the dark, find vestments <br />
            of  sorrow slumped on a wooden chair,</p>
          <p>pull  them on. Then feast <br />
            on  oranges, bitter herbs and ash. </p>
          <p>Choose  cleansing silence: <br />
            this  window, its pieces of sky, </p>
          <p>line-dried  sheets you will fold <br />
            as  quietly as light leaves the body. </p>
          <p>If in  doubt, kiss the hem <br />
            of each  new day and breathe </p>
          <p>as  gently as you press a pear to see <br />
            if it is  ripe, as slowly as you separate</p>
          <p>your  hand from the back of a sleeping child.<br />
            Praise  this life, a late-March garden          </p>
          <p>where  new growth stands<br />
          on the  bones of the old.</p>
          <p>(<em>Copper Nickel</em>) </p>
