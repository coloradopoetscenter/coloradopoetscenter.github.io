  <h1>Barbarous World</h1>  <p>If you  rise in the dark, find vestments <br /> of  sorrow slumped on a wooden chair,</p>  <p>pull  them on. Then feast <br /> on  oranges, bitter herbs and ash. </p>  <p>Choose  cleansing silence: <br /> this  window, its pieces of sky, </p>  <p>line-dried  sheets you will fold <br /> as  quietly as light leaves the body. </p>  <p>If in  doubt, kiss the hem <br /> of each  new day and breathe </p>  <p>as  gently as you press a pear to see <br /> if it is  ripe, as slowly as you separate</p>  <p>your  hand from the back of a sleeping child.<br /> Praise  this life, a late-March garden </p>  <p>where  new growth stands<br />  on the  bones of the old.</p>  <p>(<em>Copper Nickel</em>) </p>
