<h1>Mantra</h1>  <p>We  walk in dark before the dawn<br /> solemnly,  silent, moving slowly.<br /> The  soft voice of the Buddhist nun<br />  echoing  like ripples on a lake.</p>  <p> Each  of us calling to mind the breath<br /> of  being, breathing in and out<br /> joining  the land, the rocks, the trees<br />  recognizing  we are all the same and unique.</p>  <p>Thoughts  are slow, sluggish from sleep<br /> they  don't dance and interfere, not yet.<br /> We repeat, should they  arise, the phrase<br />  we've  learned to quiet them:</p>  <p>&ldquo;Breathing  in and breathing out&rdquo;.<br /> But  for me today, my mind repeats<br /> The  signs on the cottage doors:<br />  &ldquo;Keep  doors shut because of bears.&rdquo;</p>  <p>&ldquo;Keep  doors shut because of bears.&rdquo;<br />  &ldquo;Keep  doors shut because of bears.&rdquo; </p>  <p>(from <strong><em>Retreat and After: A Journal of Poetry On  Retreat with Thich Nhat Hanh in Rocky Mountain National Park</em></strong>, to be  published by Green Fuse Press 2014)<strong></strong></p>
