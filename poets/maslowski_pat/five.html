  <h1><label>Five Irises</label></h1>  <p>They weren&rsquo;t there yesterday.<br /> Today  they are full in bloom,<br /> gold,  umber, we&rsquo;ve never<br /> had  five before, all<br /> the  same color.</p>  <p>The  summer burns hot<br /> and  fast, too little snow<br /> last  winter, too little<br /> rain  this spring. The wind<br />  is  always here, it seems.</p>  <p>The  insects bounce against<br /> the  house, brrr and zzss,<br /> snap  and flurr, random<br /> things  they seem, but<br />  nothing  is, I think.</p>  <p>Now  whatever time is<br /> left,  much like this<br /> summer,  burns hot<br /> and  fast, but I&rsquo;m aware <br />  of  what is happening now.</p>  <p> It  is all tempered by impermanence,<br /> endings and beginnings<br /> we  can never detect,<br /> driven  by our sense of<br />  forever,  unlimited appetite.</p>  <p>Whine  of flies, the thump<br /> of  pine cones dropped.<br /> The  wind in waves, the drying<br /> sage,  bends the clouds, moves<br /> the  sky through dying trees.</p>  <p>(<em>Colorado Life Magazine,</em> May/June 2013)</p>
