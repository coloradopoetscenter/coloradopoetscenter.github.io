<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>&ldquo;The  Camping Trip by Pat Maslowski, winner of the 2009 Green Fuse First Chapbook  Award is the finest chapbook I&rsquo;ve come across in many years.It is a magnificent poetic journey away from  the mass media materialism we grow up with, and out into the freedom of the  natural world and patterns around us.  It  is laid out in a tightly focused, nonlinear, organic poem-sequence, demonstrating  the maturity and dedication to craft and vision which Pat Maslowski has  achieved through years of study.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>Excerpt  of a review by Jared Smith, poet and judge of the Green Fuse First Chapbook  contest.</p>
