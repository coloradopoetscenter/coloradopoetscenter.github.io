<h1>Camping  Trip</h1>  <p>We know  it's time<br /> to  get away. The house<br /> has  become our cave<br /> and  the world has narrowed<br /> to its opening.Â  Everything<br /> is  too well known, too same,<br /> too  taken for granted,<br /> has  impressed the patterns<br />  of  our days.</p>  <p>We've  become obsessed<br /> with  small things and<br /> the  continuous damage<br /> living  is.</p>  <p>We've  repaired nicks<br /> in  the walls and furniture<br /> and  tried to mend relationships<br /> that  have rusted and snapped<br /> and  we know there's never<br /> any  going back, just walking<br /> backwards,  the lack of <br /> seeing  that only brings<br /> more  broken things.</p>  <p>We'll make a camping trip<br /> to  the Southwest where<br /> the  land reveals an ancientness,<br /> strange  rock formations, fossils,<br /> corals  from an inland sea,<br /> old  cultures not immediately<br /> apparent  but still present<br /> in  ritual and spirit, concealed<br /> in  cave and canyon.</p>  <p>We  pack the camper: food,<br /> blankets,  clothes, books,<br /> computers,  maps, cameras,<br /> flashlights  for desert nights,<br /> sunscreen,  lotion for insect bites.<br /> We  leave our home behind<br />  with  its nagging memories.</p>  <p>(from <strong><em>Camping  Trip</em></strong>, Green Fuse Press, 2009)</p>
