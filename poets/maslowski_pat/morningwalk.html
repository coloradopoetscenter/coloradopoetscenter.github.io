          <h1>On Our Morning Walk</h1>
          <p>We meet a bull elk<br />
            calmly chewing <br />
            the leaves of a<br />
            newly planted<br />
            aspen tree.   We walk<br />
            slowly toward him,<br />
          a hundred of us.</p>
          <p>I start to panic<br />
            knowing it's mating<br />
            season and this <br />
            900 pound male<br />
          is aggressive now.</p>
          <p> Brother continues<br />
            to lead us closer,<br />
            closer, the elk<br />
            watches, stops, <br />
            but we continue<br />
            forward, the elk<br />
            looking directly<br />
            at us as we walk.<br />
            <br />
            Brother takes the sidewalk<br />
            to the right, branching<br />
            off. The elk has stopped<br />
            eating now, moves slowly<br />
            away as if to say,<br />
            Good Morning, glad<br />
            that we could meet.</p>
          <p>Brother Protection, I<br />
            am so relieved you<br />
            didn't confront the elk<br />
            did it exactly right,<br />
            a lesson here for me<br />
          about feelings and meetings.          </p>
