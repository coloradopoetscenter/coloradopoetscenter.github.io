<h1>Patina</h1>
<blockquote><p> --for Carlos</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my humble house of unstudied solitude</p>
<p>I lie down at night on the inevitable spare bed </p>
<p>to sleep in faraway imaginary arms.</p>
<p>At dawn I pray for the impermanence of love,</p>
<p>for the clean way things rust and fade</p>
<p>for the modest advancing light of winter</p>
<p>that seeps through the Cappuccino shades</p>
<p>and finds me before the fire on my knees</p>
<p>begging the gods to bless us with longevity, </p>
<p>serenity, a blessed place with time to meditate </p>
<p>on the bare branches of entwined arms and legs,</p>
<p>the unconventional clay of wrinkled faces, </p>
<p>the inherent weathered cobblestones of hearts,</p>
<p>the vintage wood, the natural grain of being alive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An artisan in retreat, I whisper words</p>
<p>of respect, appreciation, gratitude, then plead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please bring him safely home to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I offer them my art, the simple craftsmanship of sound,</p>
<p>in exchange for a slower pace, a space in</p>
<p>closely measured time to find exceptional peace</p>
<p>in a cup of jasmine tea, nurture the inner beauty </p>
<p>of an ordinary day, improvise good noise by</p>
<p>balancing the harmony of music and poetry.</p>
<p>In this imperfect, primitive, incomplete love--</p>
<p>as rough as wool, as thick and warm and enduring--</p>
<p>I ask them to help me see, with stunning clarity, </p>
<p>that impossible discernment, the unpretentious patina, </p>
<p>the aching, rustic beauty that comes with aging.</p>
