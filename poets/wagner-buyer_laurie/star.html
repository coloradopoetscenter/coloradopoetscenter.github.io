<h1>Star of the Stables</h1>
<p>Lordy, how I laughed when your friend eyeballed me </p>
<p>from under the wide brim of his black ten X Bailey,</p>
<p>walked over and said, &ldquo;Good God, Jake, what&rsquo;d you go</p>
<p>and do now? Pick up another sleek sister to add to your string.</p>
<p>Put that one in the spotlight and she&rsquo;ll shine.</p>
<p>Yes, siree, she could be the new star of the stables!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He clapped you on the back and tipped his hat to me</p>
<p>as you dropped your hand from my shoulder to my waist </p>
<p>and pulled me in closer, tightening up a little on the lead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he walked away, I half-preened, half-pouted: Star of the stables indeed! </p>
<p>Lordy, I&rsquo;d rather be the cream of the cavvy any day, </p>
<p>one of bunch you whistle up every morning long about daybreak...</p>
<p>and, honest, I don&rsquo;t care how many fillies frolic around your feedbag </p>
<p>as long as I&rsquo;m the one you throw your loop at each day...and, no, </p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t duck my head or bolt. I won&rsquo;t even buck. I&rsquo;ll stand sweet</p>
<p>as you please while you saddle me up--no need to tie my reins--</p>
<p>Oh, I may tremble a tiny bit when the blanket hits my bare back,</p>
<p>but every gal&rsquo;s got her sensitive spots... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="right"> And, ride! Let me</p>
<p>tell you, mister, You&rsquo;ve never known heaven until</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve settled into my jog trot. It&rsquo;s as smooth and easy</p>
<p>as sitting on the front porch swing in summertime...</p>
<p>and I want you to know that I&rsquo;m a long distance runner.</p>
<p>I can lope late afternoon into early evening and never miss a beat.</p>
<p>None of that fast dash-and-done-for-the-day sprinting for me.</p>
<p>I save myself and I don&rsquo;t have the word &ldquo;quit&rdquo; in my vocabulary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And another thing, I&rsquo;ll leave you light-hearted and breathing easy</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not flighty and I don&rsquo;t spook unless, of course, it&rsquo;s a snake</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d be doing us both a real favor to quick-like step aside.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find me a sure-footed sassy ride even if I do tend to star-gaze. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, go ahead, shake out your rope and give me a try</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t like me at the end of the day, well,</p>
<p>all I&rsquo;ll say is please don&rsquo;t leave me saddled up and sweating in the sun, </p>
<p>ground-tied to disappointment--yours and mine.</p>
<p>You just strip me clean, slap me on the rump, and turn me loose to run,</p>
<p>because cowboy, I&rsquo;ve just never seen myself as a one-man mare. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
