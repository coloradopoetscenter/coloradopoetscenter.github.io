<h1>Sleeping with the River </h1>
<p>Her voice calls me night after night</p>
<p>until finally I go down below her banks </p>
<p>and unroll my bed on the old bridge </p>
<p>that stretches between her shoulders,</p>
<p>to lie quiet and watch the egg-yolk orb </p>
<p>of the moon rise in a cloudless sky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The jealous wind objects, complaining </p>
<p>through the long light hours, tearing </p>
<p>leaves from the withes of the willow</p>
<p>above my head. Nestled in down, </p>
<p>I am restless, wakened by recurrent </p>
<p>whispers of a lover I will never hold,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the never-ending rush of water over </p>
<p>stone over stone over stone over stone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--Laurie Wagner Buyer </p>
