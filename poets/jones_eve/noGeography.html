  <h1>No Geography</h1>  <p>Captain, I write to tell you  God has left<br /> This land to us. All saved, save<br /> Two we lost to scalping, one  to self-<br /> Inflicted shot. My men rest. It is just<br /> As you said, Sir: seas of  yellow flower,<br /> Wind roaring in the throat. A savage-<br /> Less quiet of the heart, I  say, though I could not<br /> Do without your map in this wood:<br /> Crude pine for kindling, and  bees festered<br /> In the clover, as if the insect were<br /> Anything but pulled  half-drunk<br /> To the juice. The moon to find us, fading<br /> West. Some thing torn alive  every night.<br /> Sir, send our provision: salt, flour<br /> Whisky for dryness. Paring  knives and<br /> A woolen dress. We kept a girl for meals.</p>
