<h1>Sleeping  Giant</h1>  <p>Off the  coast of Ireland an island<br />  sleeps in the shape of a man.</p>  <p>To the  ones who first saw him,<br /> from a cliff edge or boat rail,</p>  <p>he must  have come out of the mist<br /> like a newly fallen god,</p>  <p> a  drowned giant, his body gone<br /> over to forest, his hair tumbling</p>  <p> into  wave-break, hands tucked,<br /> circled by birds. An island,</p>  <p> but  also a man, a recognizable god.<br /> Why do we look for ourselves</p>  <p> everywhere,  mapping distance<br /> between the heart and the wild?</p>  <p> Just on  the edge of perception something<br /> thrashes, screams, becomes a bird</p>  <p> crossing  your line of sight. Always,<br /> this fluency: a world dangling within</p>  <p> a  world, another unbearable place<br /> to inhabit. Always, lines arranging</p>  <p> the  shape as it rises. Grief: wind in<br /> a white field, the hand’s</p>  <p> slow  opening. What is time<br /> but loss and gain,</p>  <p> the  runner stumbling into the ribbon?<br /> I, too, have done it—</p>  <p> given  love a skin, a pair of arms,<br /> offered it a bed to burn in.</p>  <p> It is  the consequence of despair,<br /> of love’s strange face, any wild thing:</p>  <p> we  trace it down into something not new,<br /> but known, something that sleeps.</p>  <p>'(Originally published in <em>AGNI)</em></p>
