<h1>Fantastic Monastic</h1>
<p> The monks in every season<br />sing the world to its completion
---
chanting psalms and hymns<br />to the glory of Christ Jesus.<br /><br />How odd, <br />that so much would depend<br />on those who own<br />nothing more<br />than a robe <br />and a pair of sandals!<br /><br />And in this congregation of burning<br />human candles,<br />the works of devotion <br />are as steady as the sun <br />in its ritual motions<br />of eternal returning.<br /><br />With incense thickly burning,<br />the daily prayers revolving,<br />bread and wine dissolving<br />into this:<br /><br />the body of our most sacred days.<br /><br />As evening descends,<br />monastic crickets sing their songs<br />of praise...<br />  </p>
it  is a liturgy without end.<br />
<br />
St. Francis speaks with birds--<br />
and the cloistered worm<br />
beneath the earth <br />
softly says:<br />
<br />
Amen.
