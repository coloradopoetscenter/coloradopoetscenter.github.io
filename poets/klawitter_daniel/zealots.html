</ul>  <h1>Zealots</h1>  <p>The certainty <br /> of a fanatic<br /> makes me smile<br /> to mask my panic.<br /><br /> The truth is:<br /><br /> I pity them <br /> their lack of doubt–<br /> their fascination<br /> with damnation.<br /><br /> They want to shout you<br /> into heaven<br /> which is the worst kind<br /> of salvation! <br /><br /> The moral<br /> of the story<br /> is this:<br /><br /> Moses encountered glory<br /> in the burning <br /> of the bush–<br /><br /> but sometimes God<br /> is in a kiss--<br /> in the <em>pull</em>-<br /> and not the push.<br /><br />  (Published in <em>The Progressive Christian</em>, Summer 2009).&nbsp; </p>
