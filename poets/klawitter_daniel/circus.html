<h1>Let Them Have Bread  And A Circus</h1>
<p> This is a poem<br />about the modern day Rome<br />I see on the T.V. talk shows.<br /><br />As the warriors prepare<br />I smell the bloodlust <br />in the atmosphere of the auditorium&mdash;<br />and the worst of slobbering secrets<br />are dragged out on parade <br />for the barbarians.<br /><br />The lions in the crowd<br />are very proud indeed <br />to live in this democracy<br />of the lowest, common denominator.<br /><br />Where you are free to choose<br />from a thousand different shampoos&mdash;<br />and express your views<br />in a platitude to Caesar.<br /><br />And I forget how often I&rsquo;ve heard,<br />from some reactionary patrician<br />who has never even<br />read a word of Karl Marx,<br />blabber on for no good reason<br />how &ldquo;socialism looks good,<br />but only works on paper.&rdquo;<br /><br />And they say this with a straight face,<br />while wearing capitalist clothing<br />manufactured using child labor<br />from overseas.<br />  </p><p>
And  so as we deeply debate<br />
the latest sexual transgression<br />
of this or that celebrity&mdash;<br />
we think ourselves participants<br />
in the plurality of voices.<br />
But in this Empire of two false choices,<br />
every pundit who cares to confess<br />
is entitled to their opinion. <br />
<br />
I will not say the right<br />
to free speech<br />
is anything less<br />
than wonderful.<br />
<br />
But the common sense <br />
of these too common people<br />
just leaves me uncommonly<br />
uncomfortable.<br />
