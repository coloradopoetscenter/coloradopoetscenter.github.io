<h1>Comrades  Don&rsquo;t Die, They Multiply.</h1>
<p> For all the dreams of dark-skinned men,<br />women and children,<br />scorched and stumbling on blistered feet.<br /><br />For the nameless and numbered,<br />who were butchered like meat<br />with the sky growling thunder<br />and whose napalmed screams were silenced.<br /><br />I offer you this hymn.<br /><br />For the guns of defiance<br />and lips that curse&hellip;<br />for the peasants who barefoot<br />walk proud on the earth.<br /><br />Hacked by machetes<br />and consumed in fire<br />or hung from trees<br />like electric wires of resistance!<br /><br />I offer you this humble hymn.<br /><br />Though death be persistent,<br />one truth stays consistent in this song of our lament:<br /><br />we may be cut down,<br />but we will always return,<br />like weeds through the cement.<br />  (The People&rsquo;s Tribune, June, 2008)</p>
