<h1>Reading  Rumi</h1>
<p> I would like to be impervious<br />and dangerous as a dervish<br />whirling with poems<br />bristling like swords<br />sharp enough to cut you.<br /><br />And I would like to be spinning dizzy<br />with poetry sweet as opium,<br />eyes as sad as camels,<br />on a caravan towards utopia.<br /><br />But most of all<br />I would like to be serene.<br />Not as a cloud<br />or corpulent bloodhound...<br /><br />but more like the Sufi<br />with poems emerald green,<br />inscrutable in their symmetry.<br />  </p>
