<h1>A Charm to Learn to Relinquish </h1>
<p> Sparrow, you flurry this empty ground </p>
<p> under a barren juniper daily </p>
<p> November through March. In our peck-or-die </p>
<p> world every wingbeat demands </p>
<p> dedication to survival. </p>
<p> I, too, scratched futile dust </p>
<p> denying all evidence, risking starvation </p>
<p> and I warn you, Sparrow, </p>
<p> nothing comes of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
