title: Lois Beebe Hayna : Critical Commentary
---
 
<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p>Regarding Keeping Still: &quot;Hayna's musical poems draw us into her
world, long before we grasp the art of any one piece.  Thus lyric
after lyric can risk speaking of the fragility of existence - of risk
itself, of loss and renewal and joy and death.  Yet each poem does this
in a voice so clear and calm that we are seduced into affirming our
mortal vitality, as if we've &quot;not heard of snow.&quot;  Hayna frees us to
say 'yes' to life.&quot;John C. Jacobs, Loyola University, Chicago
