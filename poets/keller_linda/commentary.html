 <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>&quot;Linda Keller's poems swirl with sensation, memory, humor and a compelling love of nature.&quot;</p> <p> - Stephen Keating, Author of Cutthroat, winner of 1999 Colorado Book Award.</p> <p>&quot;Evocative and entertaining.&quot;</p> <p> - Christiane Citron, Former Director of Colorado Center for the Book.</p>  <p>&quot;The collection has definite gems to savor and return to over and over. Consider 'On the Shelf Lake Trail' with autumn approaching. The poet notes the abundance in nature to physically sustain living things as it gives way to emotional sustenance, leaving 'the taste bright on my tongue.' 'Making Up the Way' is another memorable poem. </p> <p> - Kathleen Hinton, Denver Public Schools, Educational Resource Services</p>  <p>These poems are written in an honest, straightforward, soul-wrenching style that will appeal to teen as well as adult readers. The language is simple, clear and beautiful; the message is one today's teens need to hear. Poets will applaud Keller's audacity and soul. Great for using in high school English classes, I recommend the book for high school and public libraries, as well as to anyone who loves language and truth.</p> <p> - Barbara Ittner, Editor, Libraries Unlimited</p>
