<h1><strong>Flash Flood </strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Too few words</p>
<p>your mouth</p>
<p>speaking</p>
<p>not in my ears.</p>
<p>The ears remember</p>
<p>the sound</p>
<p>like rocks once covered</p>
<p>by moving water</p>
<p>softening</p>
<p>rounding</p>
<p>not knowing</p>
<p>the riverbed</p>
<p>would become dry.</p>
<p>And now</p>
<p>I am the riverbed</p>
<p>in a desert.</p>
<p>The fine sand</p>
<p>covers me,</p>
<p>soaks in rain</p>
<p>when it comes,</p>
<p>remembers the wetness</p>
<p>of a flash flood.</p>
<p>You were the flood.</p>
<p>You came with your water,</p>
<p>your words in my ears,</p>
<p>and now you have</p>
<p>passed over me,</p>
<p>run downstream,</p>
<p>sinking into my parched earth,</p>
<p>disappearing around my curves,</p>
<p>leaving a pattern</p>
<p>of dark sand on pale</p>
<p>in the shape of rippled ribs,</p>
<p>the only proof</p>
<p>you were here.</p>
