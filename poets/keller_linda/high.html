 <h1><strong>High Cholesterol Blues</strong></h1> <p>I dream of pancakes</p> <p>piled on my plate</p> <p>layered with butter,</p> <p>maple syrup flowing</p> <p>across them like a</p> <p>spring stream,</p> <p>but instead</p> <p>I eat oatmeal.</p> <p>I dream of creamy milkshakes</p> <p>so thick they </p> <p>have to be eaten</p> <p>with a spoon,</p> <p>but instead</p> <p>I eat an apple.</p> <p>I am surrounded by reduced-fat this</p> <p>and fat-free that.</p> <p>The doctor says I need</p> <p>a prescription,</p> <p>but I am as determined</p> <p>as a bull in a pen.</p> <p>I run, I buy a low-fat cookbook.</p> <p>I am the model of discipline.</p> <p>I recall the days of</p> <p>quiche lorraine, pizza</p> <p>and ice cream</p> <p>as if they were as distant</p> <p>as my youth.</p> <p>I boldly flaunt</p> <p>my banner,</p> <p>&quot;Less than 20 grams of fat per day&quot;</p> <p>and I know that I will</p> <p>taste victory</p> <p>even if it isn't sweet.</p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p><em>Linda Keller </em></p> <p><em> From Comet Dreams, Tindari Press, 2004</em> </p>
