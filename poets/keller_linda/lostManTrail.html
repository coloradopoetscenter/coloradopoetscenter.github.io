<h1>Lost Man Trail</h1>
<p>Bright red stalks <br />of fading king's crown<br />bow to the earth,<br />supplicants of <br />newly chilled air.<br />A weaving at my feet<br />of gray rock, white pebbles,<br />green grass and red braids.<br />Independence Lake mirrors<br />the sky in the distance,<br />my eye, a camera,<br />  storing the colors.</p>
<p><em>(Mountain Gazette, August, 2006)</em></p>
