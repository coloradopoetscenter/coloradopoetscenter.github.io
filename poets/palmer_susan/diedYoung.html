<h1>Died Young</h1>
<p>&nbsp;My daughter left this world at age 29<br />Just after Christmas Day<br />So she could have Christmas Morning  with<br />Her husband and six-year-old son.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It didn't matter that it was cancer.<br />
She didn't care for material stuff.<br />
The body is quite material.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When she was three she spoke with angels<br />
When she was four she saw auras<br />
But they weren't important.<br />
Didn't everyone?<br />
When she was seven she saw goddesses<br />
In the ashram<br />
Where her parents forced her to live  for<br />
Four unending months.<br />
There were no possessions in the  ashram<br />
Except your clothes and chant book.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When she was nine she got her first  watch<br />
And a purse to put allowance in<br />
To go shopping.<br />
The purse was left in a shop.<br />
She didn't remember for four days that  she<br />
Ever had a purse.<br />
The watch died the second week.<br />
Another, then another, then another,<br />
Until the parents wised up and<br />
Stopped buying watches her aura  killed.<br />
For three years she left purses  places.<br />
She didn't care that she forgot them.<br />
But she pretended to,<br />
To mollify the parents.<br />
A tiny wallet, big enough for one  pocket<br />
In her jeans.&nbsp; Ah, that was perfect.<br />
She kept it for a whole year.<br />
And used it, when forced to buy<br />
Something.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Her spiritual teacher gave her<br />
An emerald ring.<br />
She owned it about two months<br />
Then gave it away to someone<br />
Who wanted it.<br />
She went to the wishing well on her  Birthday and asked for a<br />
husband.<br />
He came the next day.<br />
Two years later there was a baby.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then five years of sickness and  treatments.<br />
She didn't care for material stuff<br />
But she loved whole-heartedly and  tried<br />
To get well for them.<br />
Until there was nothing left of her<br />
To get well.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Finally the purse was left behind,<br />
And she went happily<br />
Away from the material world.</p>
