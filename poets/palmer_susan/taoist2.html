              <h1>Untitled (a  Taoist poem)</h1>
              <p>The horses gambol about<br />
                Drunk on fields of yellow dandelions<br />
          Laughing in horsey whickers</p>
              <p>Missing socks<br />
                I finally caught him in the act<br />
          The little guy in the dryer</p>
              <p>Who steals socks.<br />
  &quot;But I'm cold!&quot; he cried.<br />
  &quot;Nonsense,&quot; I replied.<br />
  &quot;One would have been  enough.&quot;<br />
  &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;they  cool off.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                Head hanging low, he led me<br />
                To the pile stuffed in the wall,<br />
                With rat-hole access.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                We pulled them out one by one.<br />
                Here, the plaid one<br />
                From ten years ago.<br />
                I loved those socks.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                Alas, all the mates<br />
                Have been trashed.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                But I'll toss two of these<br />
                Into the dryer<br />
                For each wash<br />
                From now on.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
          So the sock guy can keep warm.</p>
