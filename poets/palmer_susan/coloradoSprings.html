<h1>Colorado  Springs</h1>
<p>How can this be?<br />Five in the morning and<br />The highway is crowded.<br />Where are all these people going so  early?<br />I wanted to be the only one,<br />Cocooned in silence and serenity,<br />Leaving to go to my new life.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here a motorcycle<br />Dances the hula,<br />Weaving,<br />Squeezing between slow cars,<br />Trusting no one will put on the  brakes,<br />  Or fail to.</p>
<p>He enters unabashedly<br />From the on ramp<br />To drink in the breath<br />Of&nbsp;  steel elephants,<br />Flitting from the slaps<br />Like a mosquito,<br />  Untouchable.</p>
