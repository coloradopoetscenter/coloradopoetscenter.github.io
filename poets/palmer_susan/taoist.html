              <h1>Untitled (a  Taoist poem)&nbsp; </h1>
              <p>Today's path<br />
                Will never exist again</p>
              <p>Zen Ways<br />
                Why?<br />
                We always need &quot;why&quot;.<br />
                Every action happens.<br />
                Then we make the reason.<br />
                Every action happens.<br />
                Just so.<br />
                Reasons are just words<br />
                To make us feel safe<br />
          In an orderly universe.</p>
              <p>Guess what&hellip;.<br />
                Every action just happens.<br />
                Action is born from<br />
                The movement that is eternal,<br />
                Sometimes invisible to us,<br />
                Sometimes according to our intent.<br />
                None of it is caused by<br />
          Some god on a throne in the sky.</p>
              <p>Action, even thought, even intent is  born<br />
                From that space of pre-knowing.<br />
                Uncontrolled, free, inspiring,<br />
          Magical.</p>
