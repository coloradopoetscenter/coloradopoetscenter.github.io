<h1> The Fortune Telling Book of Dreams</h1>  <p>A dream  containing dogwood blossoms means <br /> you are  questioning your religion. A dream </p>  <p>in which  you drive a Volkswagen Jetta <br /> up a river,  as though the river were a road, </p>  <p>indicates a  general dissatisfaction with <br /> your daily  routines, but if it&rsquo;s raining </p>  <p>and the  drops don&rsquo;t splash in the water, <br /> you could  simply desire a gift from your lover. </p>  <p>Dreaming of  marigolds that grow backwards, <br /> from  blossom to seed, is a common dream </p>  <p>that  mirrors an inner need for a lost <br /> childhood  pleasure such as eating banana</p>  <p>popsicles  or reading in magnolia branches,<br /> but  dreaming of either of these is a warning </p>  <p>that a time  of loneliness is approaching. <br /> Trains in a  dream mean someone is angry. </p>  <p>Ships or  any voyage on the sea <br /> suggest you  will make a large purchase,</p>  <p>but if you  dream specifically of the Pacific, <br /> you are  still mourning a loss you believed  </p>  <p>you had  gotten over. If you dream you are shelling <br /> beans with  your great-grandmother while </p>  <p>everyone  else, including your mother, is skinning <br /> a deer, you  long to visit a place you never thought </p>  <p>you&rsquo;d want  to go. If, near the end of this dream, <br /> just after  you sit down to eat, your family leans </p>  <p>forward,  toward you, as though they share <br /> the same  body, and draws in a breath as though </p>  <p>to speak,  you should write down what <br />  they say,  because words spoken in a dream </p>  <p>mean you  are trying to remember <br /> something  someone told you years ago.</p>  <p>(first published in <em>Appalachian  Journal</em>)</p>
