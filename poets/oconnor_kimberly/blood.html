  <h1>
What the Blood Does  </h1>  <p><em>for Amelia</em></p>  <p>What the blood does is like God to me,<br /> its mysteriousness, I mean, like its color,<br /> difficult to name, not like anything but <br /> itself. No fruit is just that hue, no flower. <br /> Liquid jewel filling the vial, your blue eyes <br /> opening, closing, lashes black against <br /> your pale skin. What they do to you <br /> is simple, specific: a two-inch incision <br /> under your navel allows the appendix <br /> to be removed, the infection cleaned out, <br /> and then you&rsquo;ll heal. How it got there <br /> is less clear—<em>sometimes  we never know,</em> <br /> the surgeons say. For seven days we wait, <br /> walk in and out of the hospital atrium <br /> amid child after child with other ailments,<br /> some explainable, some incomprehensible.<br /> The sad-eyed parents share tired smiles, or don&rsquo;t.<br /> Our last day there, they take your blood again.<br /> I hold your hand, or rather, hold it down,<br /> whisper my story in your tiny ear:<br /> Once, long ago, there was a house on a hill<br /> and a garden. The grandmothers gathered <br /> the apples, cut them to pieces, simmered them<br /> all afternoon to sauce. I breathed the scent <br /> and wandered to the bank, looked down <br /> at the lake, and I dreamed of you.<br /> When the sun set the water was red.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>(first published in <em>Hayden&rsquo;s  Ferry Review</em>)</p>
