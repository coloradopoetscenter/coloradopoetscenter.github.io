          <h1>Thrush<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
          <p>From the  French, <em>fourchette,</em> the frog<br />
            of a  horse&rsquo;s foot. Songbird, a robin <br />
            or blue  one, brown-backed with <br />
          breast  spots. Or a kind of whitish rash.</p>
          <p>The frog of  a horse&rsquo;s foot—hooves<br />
            in the west  pasture, hoarse chorus <br />
            surging  from the marshes. Or bird,<br />
            a thrash in  the shadow of brambles</p>
          <p>edging the  threshed field; a blue one,<br />
            or the  robin, brown-backed, bright breast,<br />
            calls from  the willow branches. Wind <br />
            wet in the  shallow grasses, hoarse </p>
          <p>chorus  surging from the marshes, thrash <br />
            in a tangle  of brambles, spring shower <br />
            splashing  down. Rising creek rushing. <br />
            Over the  creekbed, passing shadow, </p>
          <p>cabin  window. Spring downpour, then<br />
            the  drowning. Then the drying, thrush <br />
            in the mouth  or the branches; flash of <br />
            the spade, silver, thrust in the damp pasture.          </p>
          <p>(first published in <em>Colorado  Review</em>)</p>
