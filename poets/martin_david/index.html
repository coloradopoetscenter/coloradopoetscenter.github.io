          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>David Anthony Martin hails from the wild forests and interwoven waterways of Puget Sound on Washington State's Olympic Peninsula but has made Colorado his home for nearly two decades. He lives and works in the unincorporated village of Beulah, Colorado which is nestled in the ponderosa pine and Douglas fir forests of the Wet Mountains. Growing up immersed in the seaside forests at the edge of the rain-coast and living a life close to nature has instilled in his soul an indigenous, mythopoeic sense. He is an Environmental Educator and outdoorsman whose poetry and prose reflect a unique undercurrent in the reawakening of environmental consciousness in the American West. In his formative years, the divine symbolism of religious myths and a mixture of Northwest Native American and Northern European folklore informed his vision of the Human Ecology. His contemplative body of work embodies an intimate, reverential love of Nature and the graceful, grounded wisdom he finds in the beautiful complexities of the Human experience.</p>
