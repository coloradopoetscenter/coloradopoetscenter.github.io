<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="nestedContent" -->  <h1>vessels</h1>  <p>we found the tree lying down in  the leaves<br /> by the starry-skied riverside at night<br /><br /> the length of its trunk was a deeply grooved  &amp; grey corduroy<br /> thick contrasting lines of dark and light <br /><br /> branches once raised like arms in solar praise<br /> now stretched out amongst its own lost leaves<br /> as though in relaxed star-gazing repose<br /><br /> lying down next to it similarly, our hearts  open to joy delicious,<br /> drinking deeply the full cups of each other;<br /> the wine of warm and welcomed companionship and  kisses<br /> always full and raised to the lips when we are  together <br /><br /> the muse was singing &ldquo;hidden place&rdquo; somewhere  inside<br /> though all I heard were frogs croaking, a  nearby cricket<br /> and the small sounds of hips and lips pressed  and plied<br /> fingers smiling, finding leaves in your hair&rsquo;s  gathering thicket<br /><br /> giggling, we got up and noticed a curious  skeletal shelter in the shadows,<br /> built of curved logs and limbs, and took  shelter within its hollow frame <br /> slipping through the opening as  quiet as possible;<br /> two invisible birds in a cage without a door, <br /><br /> like being inside a wooden boat in the early stages  of construction,<br /> turned upside-down as though it were intended  to sail the spaces<br /> between the canopies of the trees<br /><br /> suddenly, with the spine-like line of the keel<br /> set to the sea of the stars, the deep infinity  sparkling above<br /> how &ldquo;steer board&rdquo; came to be &ldquo;starboard&rdquo; in the  romance languages<br /> becomes a part of this story, a part of what i  know of love<br /><br /> the structure above a reflection of this  disembodied ship we are  creating,<br /> this vessel being constructed by joining lips  and limbs, hearts and<br /> hands cradling spines and fingers wetting warm  and secret rudders<br /> the tongues unspoken language raising  remembered sails<br /><br /> with no knowledge of which wind will fill these  sails tonight<br /> i keep my attention to the internal spirit  level and the wheel<br /> as the gentle swells we push through move our  bubble close to center<br /> shifting our positions by heart and head,  guiding this dream by feel<br /> and gratefully knowing that wind &amp; rain are  why the seasons fade<br /> and  roses die<br /><br /> i am satiated to take refuge in the eternal  moments of togetherness now,<br /> yet, simultaneously, to this new rich ground i  secretly wish to turn my plow <br /> for in your weather I find an  affinity, a tandem flow <br /><br /> and as sudden as a spring rain, the old  superfluous armor dissolves<br /> within me something older and deeper is  speaking clearly,<br /> without obstacle or veil of allowing this  garden to grow,<br /> and letting this sound ship sail<br /><br /> for there are no stars to be found when one&rsquo;s  eyes are fixed on the  ground,<br /> and putting our lips and hips level with that  starry pool we both drink our fill.<br />  </p>
