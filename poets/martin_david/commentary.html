          <h1>Commentary:</h1>
          
          <p>&ldquo;David  Anthony Martin is a nature poet the way Frank O&rsquo;Hara was a city poet. He has  paid attention, assimilated the beauty and mystery of his surroundings, and let  it color his poetry in delicate ways. He says, &ldquo;everything will be alright just  shut up and listen.&rdquo; He draws from dreams and folktale and myth. He  contemplates streams and trees and bears. And he does it in language that is  beguiling, sly and as lovely as a September peach. These are poems to carry in  your metaphorical pocket like small runic stones, with lines that you will want  to contemplate again and again. Like this brief poem called &ldquo;stream of  consciousness:&rdquo; &ldquo;the moon is not in the quick silver stream, the moon is in the  still, void-dark lake.&rdquo; Span is delicious reading.&rdquo;          </p>
          
          <p>&ldquo;Thoreau,  Cid Corman, Lorine Niedecker, Whalen &amp; Snyder, Sam Hamill and now David  Martin, a wilderness walker returning as the missing lynx in the lineage of  nature based poetry heartbeating it&rsquo;s way into our gorges &amp; forests – it  has the aroma of wild mushrooms &amp; the flow of a raging springmelt. The  poems span the distance between old friends. &lsquo;Less like a voice / more like a  knowing&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
          
          <p>&ldquo;Your  eyes, eyes of a bard.&rdquo;<br />

          <p>&ldquo;David&rsquo;s  poetry really connects to me. Mostly they are poems about the small things that  we all encounter. When I read his collection of poems in &ldquo;Span&rdquo; it slowed my  life down. I can&rsquo;t really remember to many times in this busy world of instant  communication where my world has slowed down.&rdquo;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Suddenly There Is A Dragonfly Inside Him</strong><br />
          by James E. Smith </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Historically, the natural world that we take  for granted and that surrounds us closer than we think has been a gratifying  subject for poets ever since the third century. The ancient Greeks wrote their  `idylls&rsquo; – praising the virtues of simple rural life.Most notably the  Transcendentalists – Thoreau, Muir, Emerson and Whitman among them realised the  negative drain of politics and religion on a community and instead focused  their attentions on the unity of man and nature, believing a simple life lived  in natural surroundings achieving self-sufficiency was the key. Their poetry  went beyond the painting of pretty pictures, it wasn&rsquo;t all about seasons and  birdsong and expressing romantic sentiments – indeed it touched on the  transcendental.In Span, David A. Martin is continuing the exploration, holding  back the grasses of uncharted territory, showing us the interconnectedness –  the ever changing complex relationship of man and nature as we move through  this new century. What he does is quite miraculous. Here we have a writer who  can broach this vulnerability, at times even confronting our  occupation/destruction of it as the human race but do so in a way that is deft  and urgent without being sentimental or sanctimonious.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>To pigeonhole Martin as  simply a nature poet isn&rsquo;t going to encompass what is on offer here in this  collection.</strong></p>
          <p>Early on in `the apple tree&rsquo; we learn there  were many things that he had hitherto kept to himself. This is the perfect  start – each successive poem serves as a revelation or insight of some sort.<br />
            Evidently Martin is equally at home writing  acorn tight three line poems as well as the sprawling streams of forty-liners.  Regardless of poem size or structure prevailing throughout is an excellent eye  and ear for detail. His recollections occupy all the senses, often bordering on  the lysergic – &ldquo;somewhere deep in a forest, far away, my heart is dreaming  faceless, afloat in ferns&rdquo; or even synesthetic – &ldquo;what does the smell of fall  look like?&rdquo; and – &ldquo;can you taste the red of the robins breast?&rdquo;.There is so  much to love here – &ldquo;sparkles of sunshine&rdquo;, &ldquo;the quench of rain&rdquo;, &ldquo;a gnawed,  slim, sliver of bone&rdquo;.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Martin is a guardian  spirit of his land, he is inviting us to feel and experience his space.</strong></p>
          <p>Not only does a wonderful sense of geography  pervade but also Martins symbiosis to the land on which he lives is made  apparent, especially when he pays homage to the honey bee&rsquo;s humming that lives  on in his oatmeal filled throat. I was particularly touched by an act of  kindness in`benevolence&rsquo; where he places a shallow plate of water to save the  wasps from drowning in the dog bowl.As the collection moves on I seem to notice  a gradual change in the poems, they become more poignant, almost totemic,  resonating deeper with me – this may have been illusory as found myself left to  do some self-reflection in my own deep dark forest.</p>
          <p> `oh, death (I laugh)&rsquo; hits home, we learn that  if he were to die he would – &ldquo;miss the society of birds&rdquo;. More so than his  human counterparts?</p>
          <p> &ldquo;Trees become skeletal in autumns endgame&rdquo;,  &ldquo;sunshine and shade is what it takes&rdquo;. There is cold murk, a &ldquo;void-dark lake&rdquo;  and an elk has been hit by a car. The circle is complete. Birth, blossom, decay  and passing.The standout piece of the collection for me is `listen&rsquo;. It is so  accomplished and rounded, acting as a microcosm for the whole book and the  natural world at large. Here the river and the mountains are cleverly  personified, their movements and flourishes examined in fantastic detail. We  discover that they operate outside of the parameters of human understanding,  which is until now – &ldquo;the mountain does not understand the word weekend, its  holidays marked by the aeonic tongue of the lichen&rdquo;.</p>
          <p> This kind of imagery isn&rsquo;t just pleasant to the  mind&rsquo;s eye – it is informative too, especially when we hear that in comparison  – &ldquo;the green haste of the chloroplast&rdquo; and the movement of sap are &ldquo;all as  fleeting as the sound of a branch brushing the sleeve of my jacket&rdquo;.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>His skill as a  translator of his experiences is astounding;</strong></p>
          <p>when I read these poems I can walk in his  footsteps trail, see what he sees and hear what he hears. I can feel the full  force of his wonderment at the unknown while eavesdropping on the minutiae of  his daily rituals.</p>
          <p> Corey Mesler&rsquo;s blurb on the back cover sums it  up perfectly; these are poems to read and re-read, poems that transport the  reader into another world that is actually our world. Then I feel all the  better for it. More please, soon David.&rdquo;          </p>
