<h1>The Collector's Tale</h1>
<p>When it was over I sat down last night,</p>
<p>shaken, and quite afraid I&rsquo;d lost my mind.</p>
<p>The objects I have loved surrounded me</p>
<p>like friends in such composed society</p>
<p>they almost rid the atmosphere of fright.</p>
<p>I collected them, perhaps, as one inclined</p>
<p>to suffer other people stoically.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, when I found Foley at my door&mdash;</p>
<p>not my shop, but here at my private home,</p>
<p>the smell of bourbon for his calling card&mdash;</p>
<p>I sighed and let him in without a word.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d only met the man two months before</p>
<p>and found his taste as tacky as they come,</p>
<p>his Indian ethic perfectly absurd.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The auction house in St. Paul where we met</p>
<p>was full that day of cherry furniture.</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t tell you why he&rsquo;d chosen me</p>
<p>to lecture all about his Cherokee</p>
<p>obsessions, but I listened&mdash;that I regret.</p>
<p>My patience with a stranger&rsquo;s geniture</p>
<p>compelled him to describe his family tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>He told me of his youth in Oklahoma,</p>
<p>his white father who steered clear of the Rez,</p>
<p>a grandma native healer who knew herbs</p>
<p>for every illness. Nothing like the &lsquo;burbs,</p>
<p>I guess. He learned to tell a real toma-</p>
<p>hawk from a handsaw, or lift his half-mad gaze</p>
<p>and &ldquo;entertain&rdquo; you with some acid barbs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>So he collected Indian artifacts,</p>
<p>the sort that sell for thousands in New York.</p>
<p>Beadwork, war shirts, arrowheads, shards of clay</p>
<p>beloved by dealers down in Santa Fe.</p>
<p>He lived to corner strangers, read them tracts</p>
<p>of his invention on the careful work</p>
<p>he would preserve and pridefully display.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Foley roamed the Great Plains in his van,</p>
<p>his thin hair tied back in a ponytail,</p>
<p>and people learned that he was smart enough</p>
<p>to deal. He made a living off this stuff,</p>
<p>became a more authenticated man.</p>
<p>But when he drank he would begin to rail</p>
<p>against the white world&rsquo;s trivializing fluff.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Last night when he came in, reeking of smoke</p>
<p>and liquor, gesticulating madly</p>
<p>as if we&rsquo;d both returned from the same bar,</p>
<p>I heard him out a while, the drunken bore,</p>
<p>endured his leaning up against my oak</p>
<p>credenza there, until at last I gladly</p>
<p>offered him a drink and a kitchen chair.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I still see him, round as a medicine ball</p>
<p>with a three-day beard, wearing his ripped jeans</p>
<p>and ratty, unlaced Nikes without socks.</p>
<p>I see him searching through two empty packs</p>
<p>and casting them aside despite my scowl,</p>
<p>opening a third, lighting up&mdash;he careens</p>
<p>into my kitchen, leaving boozy tracks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I offered brandy. He didn&rsquo;t mind the brand</p>
<p>or that I served it in a water glass.</p>
<p>He drank with simple greed, making no show</p>
<p>of thanks, and I could see he wouldn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>He told me nothing happened as he planned,</p>
<p>how he left Rasher&rsquo;s tiny shop a mess.</p>
<p><em>I killed him</em>, Foley said. <em>You got to know. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em> * </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>You know the place. Grand Avenue. The Great </em></p>
<p><em>White Way</em><em> they built over my people&rsquo;s bones </em></p>
<p><em>after the western forts made stealing safe. </em></p>
<p><em>Safe for that fucking moneyed generation </em></p>
<p><em>F. Scott Fitzgerald tried to write about&mdash; </em></p>
<p><em>and here was Rasher, selling off such crap </em></p>
<p><em>no self-respecting dealer&rsquo;d waste his time. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I heard he had good beadwork, Chippewa, </em></p>
<p><em>but when I went in all I saw was junk. </em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m thinking, Christ, the neighbors here must love him, </em></p>
<p><em>the one dusty-shuttered place on the block </em></p>
<p><em>and inside, counters filled with silver plate </em></p>
<p><em>so tarnished Mother wouldn&rsquo;t touch it, irons </em></p>
<p><em>with fraying cords and heaps of magazines. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>He had the jawbone of a buffalo </em></p>
<p><em>from </em><em>South Dakota</em><em>, an old </em><em>Enfield</em><em> rifle, </em></p>
<p><em>a horn chair (or a cut-rate replica), </em></p>
<p>German Bible, a blue-eyed Jesus framed</p>
<p><em>in bottlecaps&mdash;I mean he had everything </em></p>
<p><em>but paint-by-number sunsets, so much junk </em></p>
<p><em>I bet he hadn&rsquo;t made a sale in years. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>You got to know this guy&mdash;skinny bald head </em></p>
<p><em>and both his hands twisted from arthritis. </em></p>
<p><em>I wouldn&rsquo;t give his place a second look </em></p>
<p><em>except I heard so much about this beadwork. </em></p>
<p><em>He leads me to a case in the back room. </em></p>
<p><em>I take a look. The stuff is fucking new, </em></p>
<p><em>pure </em><em>Disneyland</em><em>, not even off the Rez. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Foley&rsquo;s glass was empty; I poured him more</p>
<p>to buy time while I thought of some excuse</p>
<p>to get him out of here. If homicide</p>
<p>indeed were his odd tale&rsquo;s conclusion, I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>rather let him pass out on my floor,</p>
<p>then dash upstairs and telephone the police.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if &ldquo;fucking&rdquo; Foley fried.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s crap, </em>he said. <em>I tell this slimy coot </em></p>
<p><em>he doesn&rsquo;t know an Indian from a dog. </em></p>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t believe I drove five hundred miles </em></p>
<p><em>to handle sentimental tourist crap.</em></p>
<p>He rolled himself upright in my kitchen chair</p>
<p>and looked at me with such complete disdain</p>
<p>that I imagined Mr. Rasher&rsquo;s stare.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I knew the man. We dealers somehow sense</p>
<p>who we trust and who the characters are.</p>
<p>I looked at my inebriated guest</p>
<p>and saw the fool-as-warrior on a quest</p>
<p>for the authentic, final recompense</p>
<p>that would rub out, in endless, private war,</p>
<p>all but his own image of the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><em>Pretty quick I see I hurt his feelings. </em></p>
<p><em>He gets all proud on me and walks around </em></p>
<p><em>pointing at this and that, </em></p>
<p><em>a World&rsquo;s Fair pin, a Maris autograph, </em></p>
<p><em>and then he takes me to a dark wood cupboard </em></p>
<p><em>and spins the combination on the lock </em></p>
<p><em>and shows me what&rsquo;s inside. The old man </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>shows me his motherfucking pride and joy. </em></p>
<p><em>I look inside his cupboard and it&rsquo;s there </em></p>
<p><em>all right&mdash;a black man&rsquo;s head with eyes sewn shut&mdash; </em></p>
<p><em>I mean this fucker&rsquo;s real, all dried and stuffed, </em></p>
<p><em>a metal ashtray planted in the skull. </em></p>
<p><em>I look and it&rsquo;s like the old man&rsquo;s nodding, </em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, yeah, you prick, now tell me this is nothing. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s looking at me looking at this head, </em></p>
<p><em>telling me he found it in a house </em></p>
<p><em>just up the street. Some dead white guy&rsquo;s estate </em></p>
<p><em>here in the liberal north allowed this coot </em></p>
<p><em>whatever his twisted little hands could take, </em></p>
<p><em>and then he hoards it away for special guests. </em></p>
<p><em>I didn&rsquo;t say a thing. I just walked out. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Now Foley filled his glass, drinking it down.</p>
<p>His irises caught fire as he lit up.</p>
<p>I sat across from him and wiped my palms</p>
<p>but inside I was setting off alarms</p>
<p>as if I should alert this sleeping town</p>
<p>that murder lived inside it. I could stop</p>
<p>the story now, I thought, but nothing calms</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>a killer when he knows he must confess,</p>
<p>and Foley&rsquo;d chosen me to hear the worst.</p>
<p><em>Weird</em>, he said, looking straight at me beyond</p>
<p>his burning cigarette. <em>I got so mad. </em></p>
<p><em>Like all I thought of was a hundred shelves </em></p>
<p><em>collecting dust in Rasher&rsquo;s shop, and how </em></p>
<p><em>a dead man&rsquo;s head lay at the center of it. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I had to get a drink. Some yuppie bar </em></p>
<p><em>that charged a fortune for its cheapest bourbon. </em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m in there while the sun sets on the street </em></p>
<p><em>and people drop in after leaving work. </em></p>
<p><em>I look at all these happy people there&mdash; </em></p>
<p><em>laughing, anyway; maybe they aren&rsquo;t happy&mdash; </em></p>
<p><em>the well-dressed women tossing back their hair, </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>the men who loosen their designer ties </em></p>
<p><em>and sip their single malts&mdash;living on bones </em></p>
<p><em>of other people, right? </em></p>
<p><em>And two blocks down the street, in Rasher&rsquo;s shop, </em></p>
<p><em>a head where someone flicked his ashes once, </em></p>
<p><em>because of course a darky can&rsquo;t be human, </em></p>
<p><em>and someone&rsquo;s family kept that darky&rsquo;s head. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>These genteel people with their decent souls </em></p>
<p><em>must have been embarrassed finding it, </em></p>
<p><em>and Rasher got it for a fucking song </em></p>
<p><em>and even he could never sell the thing. </em></p>
<p><em>No, he showed it to me just to get me, </em></p>
<p><em>just to prove I hadn&rsquo;t seen it all. </em></p>
<p><em>Well, he was right, I hadn&rsquo;t seen it all. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I didn&rsquo;t know the worst that people do </em></p>
<p><em>could be collected like a beaded bag, </em></p>
<p><em>bad medicine or good, we keep the stuff </em></p>
<p><em>and let it molder in our precious cases. </em></p>
<p><em>Some fucker cared just how he dried that head </em></p>
<p><em>and stitched the skin and cut the hole in the top&mdash; </em></p>
<p><em>big medicine for a man who liked cigars. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s just another piece of history, </em></p>
<p><em>human, like a slave yoke or a scalping knife, </em></p>
<p><em>and maybe I was drunk on yuppie booze, </em></p>
<p><em>but I knew some things had to be destroyed. </em></p>
<p><em>Hell, I could hardly walk, but I walked back, </em></p>
<p><em>knocked on Rasher&rsquo;s door until he opened, </em></p>
<p><em>pushed him aside like a bag of raked-up leaves. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe I was shouting, I don&rsquo;t know. </em></p>
<p><em>I heard him shouting at my back, and then </em></p>
<p><em>he came around between me and the case, </em></p>
<p><em>a little twisted guy with yellow teeth </em></p>
<p><em>telling me he&rsquo;d call the fucking cops. </em></p>
<p><em>I found the jawbone of that buffalo. </em></p>
<p><em>I mean I must have picked it up somewhere, </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>maybe to break the lock, but I swung hard </em></p>
<p><em>and hit that old fucker upside the head </em></p>
<p><em>and he went down so easy I was shocked. </em></p>
<p><em>He lay there moaning in a spreading pool </em></p>
<p><em>I stepped around. I broke that old jawbone </em></p>
<p><em>prizing the lock, but it snapped free, and I </em></p>
<p><em>snatched out the gruesome head. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I got it to my van all right, and then </em></p>
<p><em>went back to check on Rasher. He was dead. </em></p>
<p><em>For a while I tried to set his shop in fire </em></p>
<p><em>to see the heaps of garbage in it burn, </em></p>
<p><em>but you&rsquo;d need gasoline to get it going </em></p>
<p><em>and besides, I couldn&rsquo;t burn away the thought </em></p>
<p><em>of that weird thing I took from there tonight. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s out there, </em>Foley said. <em>I&rsquo;m parked outside </em></p>
<p><em>a few blocks down&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t find your house. </em></p>
<p><em>I knew you&rsquo;d listen to me if I came. </em></p>
<p><em>I knew you&rsquo;d never try to turn me in. </em></p>
<p><em>You want to see it? No? I didn&rsquo;t either, </em></p>
<p><em>and now I&rsquo;ll never lose that goddamned head, </em></p>
<p><em>even if I bury it and drive away. </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em> * </em></p>
<p><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>By now the bluster&rsquo;d left his shrinking frame</p>
<p>and I thought he would vomit in my glass,</p>
<p>but Foley had saved strength enough to stand,</p>
<p>while I let go of everything I&rsquo;d planned&mdash;</p>
<p>the telephone, police and bitter fame</p>
<p>that might wash over my quiet life and pass</p>
<p>away at some inaudible command.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I thought of all the dead things in my shop.</p>
<p>No object I put up was poorly made.</p>
<p>Nothing of mine was inhumane, although</p>
<p>I felt death in a kind of undertow</p>
<p>pulling my life away. <em>Make it stop,</em></p>
<p>I thought, as if poor Foley had betrayed</p>
<p>our best ideals. Of course I let him go.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The truth is, now he&rsquo;s left I feel relieved.</p>
<p>I locked the door behind him, but his smell</p>
<p>has lingered in my hallway all these hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mopped the floor, washed up, moved pots of flowers</p>
<p>to places that he touched. If I believed,</p>
<p>I would say Foley had emerged from hell.</p>
<p>I ask for help, but the silent house demurs.</p>
