              <h1>Fog Horns<br />
              </h1>
              <p>The loneliest days,<br />
                damp and indistinct,<br />
          sea and land a haze.</p>
              <p>And purple fog horns<br />
                blossomed over tides--<br />
          bruises being born</p>
              <p>in silence, so slow,<br />
                so out there, around,<br />
          above and below.</p>
              <p>In such hurts of sound<br />
                the known world became<br />
          neither flat nor round.</p>
              <p>The steaming tea pot<br />
                was all we fathomed<br />
          of is and is not.</p>
              <p>The hours were hallways<br />
                with doors at the ends<br />
          opened into days</p>
              <p>fading into night<br />
                and the scattering<br />
          particles of light.</p>
              <p>Nothing was done then.<br />
                Nothing was ever<br />
          done. Then it was done.</p>
