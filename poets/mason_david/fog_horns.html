<h1>Fog Horns<br />
</h1>
<p>The loneliest days,<br />damp and indistinct,<br />  sea and land a haze.</p>
<p>And purple fog horns<br />blossomed over tides--<br />  bruises being born</p>
<p>in silence, so slow,<br />so out there, around,<br />  above and below.</p>
<p>In such hurts of sound<br />the known world became<br />  neither flat nor round.</p>
<p>The steaming tea pot<br />was all we fathomed<br />  of is and is not.</p>
<p>The hours were hallways<br />with doors at the ends<br />  opened into days</p>
<p>fading into night<br />and the scattering<br />  particles of light.</p>
<p>Nothing was done then.<br />Nothing was ever<br />  done. Then it was done.</p>
