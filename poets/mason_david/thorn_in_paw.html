              <h1>A Thorn in the Paw
              </h1>
              <p>Once I was a young dog with a big thorn<br />
                in its paw, slowly becoming that very thorn,<br />
                not the howl but the thing<br />
          howled at, importunate, printing in blood.</p>
              <p>Others grew up with chrism, incense, law,<br />
                but I was exiled from the start to stare<br />
                at lightning hurled from the sky<br />
          into a lake that revealed only itself.</p>
              <p>Others had pews and prayer-shawls, old fathers<br />
                telling them when to kneel and what to say.<br />
                I had only my eyes<br />
          my tongue my nose my skin and feeble ears.</p>
              <p>Dove of descent, fat worm of contention,<br />
                bogeyman, Author&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get rid of you<br />
                merely by hating the world<br />
          when people behave at their too-human worst.</p>
              <p>Birds high up in their summer baldachin<br />
                obey the messages of wind and leaves.<br />
                Their airy hosannas<br />
          can build a whole day out of worming and song.</p>
              <p>I&rsquo;ve worked at the thorn, I&rsquo;ve stood by the shore<br />
                of the marvelous, drop-jawed and jabbering.<br />
                Nobody gave me a god<br />
          so I perfect my idolatry of doubt.</p>
