              <p>Bouboulina's Parrot</p>
              <p> After Kazantzakis</p>
              <p>What can you do with Bouboulina&rsquo;s parrot<br />
                but give it away to the last mad monk,<br />
                the one who taught a blackbird how to whistle<br />
                the Kyrie Eleison? That garish parrot,<br />
                risen from a smudged life, can only say<br />
                old lovers&rsquo; names, so yes, give it away<br />
                even if it is everything you have,<br />
                and write to the good friend of the green stone,<br />
                the last great thing you&rsquo;ve seen with your own eyes:<br />
                Come see, come see the most wonderful stone.<br />
                Give it away. Give everything away.<br />
                Let others hear of Bouboulina&rsquo;s love<br />
                and feel her absence underneath the sheets<br />
          of every bed, hollow as repeated names.</p>
