<h1>In Search of the Lost Indian Princes</h1>
<p>As the sun goes down</p>
<p>on the sput-sput of lawn sprinklers</p>
<p>in St. Pete, the long shush</p>
<p>and dull clink of shuffleboard ceases.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The mammoth white-stucco hotels</p>
<p>begin to glow in the dusk</p>
<p>with a kind of vacant dignity. </p>
<p>I can feel foundations settling</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>those critical inches toward sea level,</p>
<p>window sills crumbling, moist </p>
<p>and soft as angel-food cake. </p>
<p>Ah, the insidious leisure of decay!</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m driving a rented car</p>
<p>down palm-lined boulevards.</p>
<p>The traffic signals bob with wind </p>
<p>off the bay, their Christmas colors sad </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>and directing no one, surely not me. </p>
<p>After blocks of derelict sidewalk, </p>
<p>faded life-vests dangling askew </p>
<p>in murky storefronts, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I pull to a light beside </p>
<p>the Arthur Murray School of Dance,</p>
<p>the whole corner a wedge of light</p>
<p>sealed in plate glass. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The floor sways with gray-haired couples </p>
<p>holding each other with ease </p>
<p>and affection, turning in sure slowness </p>
<p>to a music I can&rsquo;t hear. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Suspended among lurking</p>
<p>and disinterested facades, </p>
<p>they drift in an other-worldly glow.</p>
<p>The light goes green. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ahead, the road extends </p>
<p>into the wavering salt flat of the Bay.</p>
<p>The palms, stooped ancestral gods,</p>
<p>gently clack their manes and nod.</p>
