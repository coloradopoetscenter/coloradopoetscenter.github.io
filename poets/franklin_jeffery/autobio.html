              <h1>To a Student who Reads &quot;The Second Coming&quot; as Sexual Autobiography</h1>
              <p>Reading your essay, I find the &ldquo;widening gyre&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Might be Maude Gonne&rsquo;s; falcon and falconer,</p>
              <p>The disaffected lovers who can&rsquo;t hold</p>
              <p>The bitter-sweet anarchy of their world</p>
              <p>After her &ldquo;blood-dimmed tide&rdquo; is loosed, and everywhere</p>
              <p>Illusions of lost innocence are drowned.</p>
              <p>Lovers, you say, (&ldquo;the best ones like the worst&rdquo;!)</p>
              <p>Are blinded by passionate intensity.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Surely, to claim a second coming&rsquo;s at hand</p>
              <p>Bodes well for romance; on the other hand,</p>
              <p>It smacks of locker-room bravado, a lout</p>
              <p>Who thinks his &ldquo;vast image&rdquo; a <em>Spiritus Mundi</em></p>
              <p>Rising again, unsated, for dessert,</p>
              <p>His prowess more a lion&rsquo;s than average man&rsquo;s,</p>
              <p>His &ldquo;slow thighs&rdquo; moving. Yes, that pitiless sun</p>
              <p><em>Might</em> signify his coldness after it,</p>
              <p>Her indignation&rsquo;s reeling desert birds</p>
              <p>As he rolls over to a stony sleep.</p>
              <p>More than leaving her to rock the cradle</p>
              <p>Of unprotected sex, that twice he didn&rsquo;t last</p>
              <p>For her to finish, you close, &ldquo;cannot be borne.&rdquo;</p>
