<h1> Where We Lay Down </h1>
<p class="indent"><em> for Henry </em></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>We slept that summer on the second-story porch, </p>
<p>Our cots within arms reach, and talked of school </p>
<p>Or a trick played on Charlotte, our voices dropping</p>
<p>As the watery half-light drew itself back out</p>
<p>Through the cut-paper layering of leaves. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When the chorus of trees began to whine and pitch, </p>
<p>The leaves singing the song of distances, </p>
<p>And someone took the sky and shook it out</p>
<p>With sparks like mother shook from white laundry,</p>
<p>The rain beat through the screen, and we leapt up,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Scooting the cots to center floor, jumped back</p>
<p>In the damp sheets, shivering though it was hot.</p>
<p>The next flash fixed us in a marble frieze.</p>
<p>Years later, waking in the receding tug of dream,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear again the runoff falling from the eaves</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In rivulets, drops, then slower, heavier drops,</p>
<p>And find the line of pock marks in the dirt, </p>
<p>And lift your head to see the slice of roof</p>
<p>Against the sky&rsquo;s blue invitation, which you </p>
<p>Accepted, and know then that Charlotte is dead</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>And so somehow still too young to join us </p>
<p>In the darkening air. Recall for me then what</p>
<p>I always meant to say before it began</p>
<p>When the leaves dropped and turned at once in a hush: </p>
<p>If this storm will take me, I will give it my arms and rise up.</p>
