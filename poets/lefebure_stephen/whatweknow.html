<h1>What We Know</h1>
<p>What we know of life amounts to this:<br />That at the end of work we feel a weight<br />Lifted from our shoulders; that the hours<br />Spent with lovers are the ones we miss;<br />That we regret the times we hesitate<br />Most; that an amnesia devours<br />Much of what we feel; that one good kiss<br />Was often what we needed; that a great<br />Wine, saved up indefinitely, sours;<br />That quiet moments are a kind of bliss;<br />And that these lives we struggled to create<br />  Have only intermittently been ours.</p>
