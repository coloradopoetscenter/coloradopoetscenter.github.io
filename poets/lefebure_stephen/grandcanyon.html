<h1>The Grand Canyon</h1>
<p>As if there were instead some limit<br />To this world which follows where we go;<br />As if we could renounce the many<br />Habits we acquired long ago;<br />As if we could embrace the infinite<br />Spaces we traverse like falling snow;<br />Or as if we ourselves had any<br />Substance, and were present; even so,<br />Just when we are ready to admit<br />Defeat we find ourselves on this plateau<br />Staring out across long violet<br />  Reaches filling up with indigo.</p>
