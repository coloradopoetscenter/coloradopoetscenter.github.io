<h1>Mount Evans, Colorado</h1>
<p>There is a spirit in the upper air<br />
That does not travel to the earth below,<br />
But frequents mountain tops, and dwells alone.<br />
Those who venture here have been aware<br />
For years of something palpable, although<br />
Invisible. It lingers in the zone<br />
Above the trees, where visitors are rare<br />
And even in high summer there is snow<br />
Along the slopes, and ice upon the stone.<br />
I do not believe that it would care<br />
If all the world had perished long ago,<br />
So long as it could call these peaks its own.</p>
<p>from <em>Wilderness </em>(2000)</p>
