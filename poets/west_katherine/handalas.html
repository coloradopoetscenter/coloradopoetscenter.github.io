<h1>Mandalas</h1>
<p>You are the still point <br />
At the center&mdash;<br />
Though you are not still <br />
Though you snow <br />
From east to west and <br />
The invisible moon <br />
Glows through your grainy <br />
White <br />
Lighting the way like an old <br />
Lantern </p>
<p>You are the still point <br />At the center&mdash;<br />The old pine growing up <br />From between the rocks <br />Alone at the edge <br />Of the hill<br />A leader without <br />  A tribe </p>
<p>You are the still point <br />At the center&mdash;<br />You stand with arms <br />Outstretched <br />You are the four <br />Directions <br />You are the sundial <br />You are the Stonehenge <br />Calendar <br />The ritual <br />The living <br />  The dead </p>
<p>You are the still point <br />At the center&mdash;<br />I travel your orbit <br />Like the moon <br />I travel with you <br />I always face you <br />My dark side <br />  Unknown </p>
<p>You are the vanishing point&mdash;<br />I walk towards you <br />  You move </p>
<p>You are the vanishing point&mdash;<br />Everywhere I look <br />  You vanish </p>
<p>You are the still point <br />At the center&mdash;<br />On cold mornings <br />I can touch your <br />Body <br />I can hold it close <br />Wear it <br />Like a living <br />Amulet <br />  A living stone </p>
<p>You are the vanishing point&mdash;<br />You go down <br />With the sun<br />Like a horse <br />I must lie <br />On the earth <br />  To feel your warmth </p>
<p>You are the still point <br />At the center&mdash;<br />Though you are not still <br />Though you force <br />Your breath <br />From my mouth <br />Though your heart beats <br />A strange drum <br />  In my chest </p>
