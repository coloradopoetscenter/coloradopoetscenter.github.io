<h1>Tomb Figurine</h1>
<p>My eye was a little sun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  working<br />In reverse. Flame cast light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but did not blind;<br />A stone threw heat it gained and glowed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darking<br />As it cooled. I threw my sight down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in lines<br />On lines:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadows  that dropt light upward as shade<br />That shines. <em>Day</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a syllable that dawns<br />On western margin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>noon</em> a fiery point<br />Pressing a circle down in grass it cannot burn<br />As if a deer woke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  walked east into night&mdash;<br />Day was sleep&rsquo;s shape left alone in a field. <br />Nothing was the sun. Hours polishing rhyme<br />Into a silver knob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  at line&rsquo;s end locked<br />On my study&rsquo;s door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No heat save breath&mdash;<br />  The sun a distant eye&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  working in reverse. </p>
