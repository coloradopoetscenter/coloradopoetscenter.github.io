<h1><em>Poem (The Minute Gears)</em></h1>
<p>The minute gears mutely whir. To put your ear<br />Against it is to put your ear inside it.<br />It does not tick. It isn&rsquo;t a heart.<br />It has no pulse. It isn&rsquo;t a clock or a wrist.<br />Scrutiny can coax no secret from it.<br />There is no hearse with one flat tire<br />In endless circuit, headlights dispersed<br />In fog like sunset behind a veil.<br />A paving stone extends a grave through iron<br />Gate to a door at home. To knock<br />Your hand against it puts your hand inside it,<br />As in a cloud at night the pale moon<br />Gathers itself outside itself its own light<br />And glows dimly behind the dust that outshines it.<br />It has no heat. It isn&rsquo;t the sun.<br />It isn&rsquo;t uncertain. It does not think<br />About the sun or the distant balls of dirt<br />And ice that circle closer to the star<br />With each circuit done. Comet tails <br />Darkly flowing back as the horse leaps<br />Forward, straining against the catafalque<br />All November, predict disaster as grammar<br />Predicts breath, the need to breathe, or the mind<br />Must rest. It is its own edgeless disaster.<br />It is there as if it were not there. Vague<br />Repetitions haunt the circumference. <br />To walk out the door is to place your foot<br />On a stone worn away by another&rsquo;s foot.<br />Rumor has it that the sun sends heat in form<br />Of sight. Watch the ice as it melts<br />For proof: water pools, darkens on a stone,<br />Becomes as a shadow on a stone,<br />A horse&rsquo;s hoof as it rises off a stone,<br />Except it rises forever, and the shadow is gone. <br />Such processes turn the minute gears.<br />It is not a note in the margin. The margin is<br />Covered with snow. When the winter fog<br />Disperses a black horse stands on ice<br />And cannot move. It is as if a breathless song<br />Hovered like a veil in the air. The black<br />Horse&rsquo;s breath spirals upward like smoke.<br />Pyre-smoke like a thumbprint as a cloud.<br />Similes sing mutely in it, likening the unlike.<br />Mourners name the peace they find and walk<br />Away. To step into it is to find it missing.<br />The footprints are before you as you go.<br />&nbsp;<br />  [first published in <em>The Cultural Society</em>]</p>
