<h1>The Badman John Sprockett Explains His Chivalry to Women and His Love of Books: Gold Creek, Colorado Territory, 1871 (from <em>The Widow&rsquo;s Burden</em>) </h1>
<p>In her few free minutes,</p>
<p>Mama&rsquo;d read me poems,</p>
<p>rhymes sweet as a sugar-tit.</p>
<p>The last time, me fifteen</p>
<p>and strong as railroad ties,</p>
<p>Pa spat she was Devil-spawn,</p>
<p>and laid into her</p>
<p>like a centurion with a whip,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>shoved her into the table,</p>
<p>dinner crashing against the walls,</p>
<p>ripped her book&rsquo;s pages</p>
<p>like decks of blushing cards,</p>
<p>then threw it into the hearth,</p>
<p>Mama begging, &ldquo;God loves beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty&rsquo;s a sin!&rdquo; he bellowed,</p>
<p>slapped her so hard she fell</p>
<p>like a galloping mount caught</p>
<p>by a gaping gopher hole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I hit him</p>
<p>with his Bible, heavy as an anvil:</p>
<p>hit him and hit him and hit him,</p>
<p>till he didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night she was fever-took.</p>
<p>She breathed easier to hear me</p>
<p>recite poems like birdsong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful she passed peaceful,</p>
<p>the finest woman to walk this earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I buried her,</p>
<p>left him for the hogs and buzzards,</p>
<p>I saddled his favorite horse</p>
<p>and rode off slow and mean.</p>
