<h1>Big Ed Dennehy, Owner of the First Saloon in Gold Creek</h1>
<p> (from <em>In the Colorado Gold Fever Mountains</em>)</p>
<p>What do thirsty men need?</p>
<p>Not God, Who just sends cave-ins</p>
<p>to test their faith, when faith demands</p>
<p>a little miracle now and then.</p>
<p>Nor do they need a bed under a flimsy roof</p>
<p>when ten feet of snow&rsquo;ll crush everything</p>
<p>inside, like flies in a boy&rsquo;s fist;</p>
<p>nor a nagging wife he&rsquo;d sooner punch</p>
<p>when supper&rsquo;s not to his liking;</p>
<p>and surely not brats, shrieking banshees</p>
<p>with snotty, outstretched palms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, what a man really craves is a good,</p>
<p>head-clearing drink at a fair price.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder the first public building</p>
<p>to rise under these glittering peaks</p>
<p>and beside these streams crammed</p>
<p>with the biggest nuggets this side</p>
<p>of the Almighty&rsquo;s treasure chests</p>
<p>is my saloon, a fortress against despair?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the freight-wagons carrying the barrels</p>
<p>stopped in front of the lot that&rsquo;d house</p>
<p>my Palace of the Restoration of the Spirit,</p>
<p>men clamored for drinks as if cheering on</p>
<p>General Sherman giving Rebs no quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Makes me proud to be an American.
