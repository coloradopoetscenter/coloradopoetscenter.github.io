<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p>&ldquo;These are driving, sensuous poems, not at all talky or merely historical or cerebral: they vive the feel of a region we could locate on a map, a rich Spoon river Anthology of the mountain West, told with all the splendid aspects of the craft.&rdquo;&mdash;Walt McDonald, Former Director of Creative, English Department, Texas Tech University (on <em>In the Colorado Gold Fever Mountains) </em></p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . these wonderfully chosen &lsquo;scenes&rsquo; from a life teeming with family, friends and adversaries give the reader not biography, not history, but a glimpse into the life of John Keats, the man . . . earthy, surprising and original.&rdquo;&mdash;Marie Harris, Poet Laureate of New Hampshire (on <em>Petitions for Immortality: Scenes from the Life of John Keats)</em></p>
