<h1>Jumbo and Alice (from GREATEST HITS)</h1>
<blockquote><p> Jumbo the Elephant was struck and killed by a freight train at St. Thomas,</p><p> Ontario. He was stuffed and continued to be exhibited with his mate, Alice&mdash;</p><p> Historical Products Calendar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An elephant never forgets his past lives,</p>
<p>or so the Hindu legends say.</p>
<p>One wonders what Jumbo next became,</p>
<p>what soul expansive enough</p>
<p>to house that gently huge body:</p>
<p>at his best, graceful as a whippet</p>
<p>or race horse, though in larger slow motion.</p>
<p>One wonders, too, how Alice felt,</p>
<p>to have the facsimile, never the fact,</p>
<p>before her. Did she at first </p>
<p>trumpet a welcome after his absence,</p>
<p>try to unfreeze him with a flirty</p>
<p>sway of her head and shoulders,</p>
<p>a nudge from her more</p>
<p>than comforting hindquarters?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps she accepted his immobility,</p>
<p>cumbersome as a mountain to maneuver </p>
<p>around him in their cage or the ring,</p>
<p>no longer a need to shackle his feet</p>
<p>loving to climb the air when children</p>
<p>gaped their mouths wider than his withers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But perhaps hope thudded dimly</p>
<p>in her heart at the sight of him</p>
<p>in the rain, drops slithering down</p>
<p>his gray forehead she had so loved</p>
<p>to nuzzle. Perhaps she mistook</p>
<p>the water for tears&mdash;he too</p>
<p>remembering his last life,</p>
<p>the best one, rolling back to him</p>
<p>behind eyes glittery as marbles</p>
<p>while he waited with the patience</p>
<p> of elephants for his next life to begin. </p>
