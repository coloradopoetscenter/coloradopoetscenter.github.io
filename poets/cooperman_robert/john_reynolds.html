<h1>John Reynolds, Dying, Remembers John Keats
	&quot;Friend of Keats&quot;-carved on Reynolds' headstone
</h1>
<p>The Isle of Wight&rsquo;s my final way station:</p>
<p>consumption perched on my chest, hissing,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move, and pain will rip you like a kestrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John came here to write <em>Endymion</em></p>
<p>at the start of his too-short career.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fitting charnel house</p>
<p>for me to brood upon my daughter:</p>
<p>so small, I had hoped Death might miss her.</p>
<p>He overlooks no one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only I had possessed John&rsquo;s courage,</p>
<p>and not slunk off from Poetry to Law&mdash;</p>
<p>a calling I had as much aptitude for</p>
<p>as a pig for preaching!</p>
<p>I lost myself in labyrinths of Chancery:</p>
<p>unholy spawn of Greed and Procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as well I have no strength</p>
<p>to look out my window.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d see a dead-wall</p>
<p>like the crypts of Inns of Court,</p>
<p>not the surf John described in letters.</p>
<p>I make my wife read the yellowed pages,</p>
<p>and see his face, rosy as Homer&rsquo;s dawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pray we meet again, dear friend:</p>
<p>to sit in the Library of Paradise</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll compose odes praising</p>
<p>angel and imp with equal delight,</p>
<p>to make the seraphs laugh and rage,</p>
<p>my daughter clap tiny hands for joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what if there&rsquo;s only damp ground,</p>
<p>dreamless sleep? My tombstone must suffice:</p>
<p>to tell men I lived and died,</p>
<p>and was friend to immortal John Keats.</p>
