<h1><strong>Night Shift</strong></h1>
<p>Let us now praise the night shift&mdash;</p>
<p>those on the 8 to 4, the 10 to 6,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>the 10-hour or 12-hour shift,</p>
<p>the bread bakers pounding and leavening,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>the pastry cooks rolling and filling,</p>
<p>the sleep-deprived, the heavy-eyed,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>the pale and dark ones sleeping</p>
<p>through their days, ambulance drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>with their bright sirens, pilots</p>
<p>whose planes move like wandering stars,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>the dawn-obsessed, the checkers of watches,</p>
<p>nurses slipping into unlit rooms,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>the uniformed, the dressed-down, the truckers </p>
<p>with their high beams on, the wired,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>the goosed up, the dragged down,</p>
<p>the lost and lonely selling tickets at dim windows,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>girls who kick their shoes off, the ones </p>
<p>who walk the aisles, security staff, night watchmen,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>all those who guard our nights,</p>
<p>unsmiling collectors of tolls, bouncers</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>at the after-hours bars, strummers </p>
<p>of guitars, ticklers of drums, working</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>in the shadow world where fluorescent lights</p>
<p>stand in for sun and flashes of neon</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>pass for stars. Let us praise the yawners </p>
<p>and those who stretch to stay awake,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>coffee hounds, speed freaks, Coke drinkers,</p>
<p>women splashing water on their faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Remember the blackjack dealers with their gleaming cards,</p>
<p>waitresses sleepwalking from table to table,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>taxi drivers with a gun in the glove,</p>
<p>all the weary, the fearful, the men</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>who never see their wives, the nervous babysitters,</p>
<p>those dancing to strange music, the clank</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>and drone of the factory machines,</p>
<p>printers rolling out the news, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>all those dreaming of dawn and sleep</p>
<p>until, at last, in the first hint of light, the clerk </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>alone in the 7-11 counts the change in the cash drawer </p>
<p>and closes out the night.</p>
