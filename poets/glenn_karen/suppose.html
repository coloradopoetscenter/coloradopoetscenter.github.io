<h1><strong>Suppose</strong></h1>
<p>everything is OK. There really is</p>
<p>nothing to worry about. Days go by, </p>
<p>a trainload of marshmallows. </p>
<p>You have no problems; </p>
<p>the sky is clear as vodka.</p>
<p>The rain doesn&rsquo;t fall, but the oleanders, </p>
<p>the magnolias, the insistent camellias </p>
<p>keep right on blooming.</p>
<p class="indent"> Winter is banished. </p>
<p>Spring starts over again, </p>
<p>pushing its way out of the earth, </p>
<p>each and every dawn, like a beautiful corpse </p>
<p>that really can rise again.</p>
<p class="indent"> Your lover is faithful now, </p>
<p>brings champagne every afternoon. </p>
<p>Each evening, under the unchanging stars, </p>
<p>the sex is so good that, even when you try, </p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stop coming.</p>
<p class="indent"> There is no death, </p>
<p>no aging. You stay just as you are. </p>
<p>And if anything bothers you, </p>
<p>it is only the slightest twinge. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even feel it, as you stare out </p>
<p>across that ever-blue horizon, where the future </p>
<p>goes on and on and on, looking </p>
<p>exactly like today.</p>
