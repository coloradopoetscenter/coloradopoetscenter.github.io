  <h1>1991: A List of Demands </h1>  <p>Fourteen  yellowjackets scouring the weeping,<br />  cracked  face of a crabapple.</p>  <p>A  blood-heavy sun<br /> pitched  low above an outstretched palm.</p>  <p>The  moment when the boy's dampsilk hair <br /> and  the braille of sand on bare legs<br /> are  one thing. </p>  <p>Light:  a six foot scrim<br /> of  white, the hour pushing<br /> through  the dark room.</p>  <p>Two  colors from a newly sodded lawn,<br /> a  torn-open chest releasing<br /> bluejays  and nightcrawlers.</p>  <p>The  exact odor a sun-baked<br /> horseshoe  crab releases<br /> when  turned over with a driftwood stick.</p>  <p>My  father's face like an obol<br /> and  two months remaining.</p>  <p>Wild  cells shadowing the backlit<br /> silhouette  of his brain,<br /> a  fin breaching green water. </p>  <p>A  few hundred days<br /> soaked  in gasoline, tented on timber,<br /> set  alight.</p>  <p>One  warm gust, more caress than air,<br /> as  year passes from time to memory to ash.</p>  <p>An  excision of all these things.Â  </p>
