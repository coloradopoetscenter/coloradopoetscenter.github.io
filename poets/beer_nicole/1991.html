          <h1>1991: A List of Demands          </h1>
          <p>Fourteen  yellowjackets scouring the weeping,<br />
          cracked  face of a crabapple.</p>
          <p>A  blood-heavy sun<br />
            pitched  low above an outstretched palm.</p>
          <p>The  moment when the boy's dampsilk hair <br />
            and  the braille of sand on bare legs<br />
            are  one thing. </p>
          <p>Light:  a six foot scrim<br />
            of  white, the hour pushing<br />
            through  the dark room.</p>
          <p>Two  colors from a newly sodded lawn,<br />
            a  torn-open chest releasing<br />
            bluejays  and nightcrawlers.</p>
          <p>The  exact odor a sun-baked<br />
            horseshoe  crab releases<br />
            when  turned over with a driftwood stick.</p>
          <p>My  father's face like an obol<br />
            and  two months remaining.</p>
          <p>Wild  cells shadowing the backlit<br />
            silhouette  of his brain,<br />
            a  fin breaching green water. </p>
          <p>A  few hundred days<br />
            soaked  in gasoline, tented on timber,<br />
            set  alight.</p>
          <p>One  warm gust, more caress than air,<br />
            as  year passes from time to memory to ash.</p>
          <p>An  excision of all these things.Â  </p>
