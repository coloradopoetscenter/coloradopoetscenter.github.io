          <h1>The Floating Girl          </h1>
          <p>In Teraoka’s <em>Wave Series</em> paintings the cephalopods seduce young female divers,  spread tentacles massing from corner to corner in erotic landscapes; despite  the stark Ukiyo-e inkstrokes delineating these contours into parabolic clarity,  the scenes of “loving cunnilingus” between beast and woman creates a fantastic  aesthetic confusion: you can barely differentiate the ocean waves from the  indigo tattoos surging in breakers up her body, the tide of legs engulfing her  (you nearly miss the spread, fine-haired holothurian of her sex in all the  visual noise)…And how can such an encounter end?  Does she succumb to the enamored, oceanic maw  of her lover, a feast ravishing and ravished to be digested in the massive  pouch of some lightless Marianas?  Or  does she survive, but spend moonless nights in her husband’s bed longing for a  confusion of limbs unencumbered by bone?   Or perhaps there is no end to this, only an abiding Möbius strip, chiral  and irreconcilable, a lesson in how ardor ignites not in unlikeness, but  unlikelihood: desire’s sought-after moment of dissolution when <em>What </em>surrenders entirely to <em>How</em>.  </p>
