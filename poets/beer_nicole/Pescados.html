  <h1><em>Pescados de Pesadillas</em></h1>  <p>  <em>Nightmare fish</em></p>  <p>When  Dali submerged the young octopus<br /> he’d  found on the Catalan seashore<br /> in  acid, it was not <br />to watch the violent<br /> irradiation  of its skin from pearlescence<br /> to  wounded rose nor the convulsive<br /> arabesques  of its arms in the corrosive bath,<br /> nor  even for the etching he made<br /> from  its corpse so that Medusa <br /> might  be mantled with spectral, <br /> tentacular  snakes, <br />  but that <br /> he  might earn from his transgression a lifetime <br /> of  dreams in which many-armed remorse <br /> would  roost upon his shoulder, lay <br /> a  chilled, reproachful catenary against his cheek<br /> and  in the instant before his ears turned <br /> to  granite he could at last hear <br /> the  soft, slightly acrid voice <br /> pressing  him for an answer <br /> to  its dark, indelible question.</p>
