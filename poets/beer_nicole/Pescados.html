          <p>                                                     <em>Nightmare fish</em></p>
          <p>When  Dali submerged the young octopus<br />
            he’d  found on the Catalan seashore<br />
            in  acid, it was not <br />
                                      to watch the violent<br />
            irradiation  of its skin from pearlescence<br />
            to  wounded rose nor the convulsive<br />
            arabesques  of its arms in the corrosive bath,<br />
            nor  even for the etching he made<br />
            from  its corpse so that Medusa <br />
            might  be mantled with spectral, <br />
            tentacular  snakes, <br />
                                     but that <br />
            he  might earn from his transgression a lifetime <br />
            of  dreams in which many-armed remorse <br />
            would  roost upon his shoulder, lay <br />
            a  chilled, reproachful catenary against his cheek<br />
            and  in the instant before his ears turned <br />
            to  granite he could at last hear <br />
            the  soft, slightly acrid voice <br />
            pressing  him for an answer <br />
            to  its dark, indelible question.</p>
