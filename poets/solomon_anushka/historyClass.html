<h1>History Class</h1>
<p>In History Class, Mrs. Raj, wound up in a green sari,<br />Talked around the clock about <em>kapal- kapal </em><br /><em>Iropah</em> that would dock, occasionally, as I nod<br />  Off, Mrs.Raj would stop. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up your socks!&rdquo; she&rsquo;d say, like a siren<br />Distressing our ears, and all the poor dears<br />  In History Class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I. PULL. MY. BLOODY.  WHITE. SOCKS. UP.<br />And gulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must mix history up and drink it down&rdquo; Mrs.<br />Raj said in a voice, cold as glass and Seven-Up.<br />&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no, no!<br />ABSOLUTELY NO. <br />Sleepy heads in class. You go!<br />GO! And stand outside. <br />I Decide. This is a circus, <br />Madness! This is NOT, this IS&hellip;<br />THIS IS HISTORY <br />  CLASS&rdquo;. </p>
<p>We, the locals, find this funny and laugh.<br />History for us, like the cannons, is a blast.<br />&nbsp;<br />Someone who&rsquo;d been to the ISKL- for a period <br />As short as a bell -barfed in the back of the class.<br />&nbsp;<br />The ISKL is the International School of Kuala Lumpur<br />It is the Upper Class, you and I, are DELETE.<br />NOT THE ELITE, so love song,<br />  You and I can read </p>
<p>History and Law<br />But there is not one place INTERNATIONAL, you <br />And I can go, Love song! <br />No matter what seeds we sow<br />The Malay language and elite <br />Sit on our head<br />As we row the same boat<br />&nbsp; <br />&ldquo;Duduk! Duduk! Duduk!&nbsp;  Sit down you clown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Teacher, Mrs.Raj, you told me to GO!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; Yes but you don&rsquo;t go till I tell you to GO!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&ldquo;You girls are getting as bold as brass. Don&rsquo;t think I <br />Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; she said, lifting her eyebrows, &ldquo;What <br />You are doing <em>outside</em><br />  THE CLASS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then calming down, &ldquo;History is a subject you cannot<br />Afford to reject, the old truths are always there </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, teacher, the world is laid bare<br />But it is not fair, alas! It only belongs to the fair!&rdquo;<br />Said one poetic soul whittle thin like a pencil<br />  Boring a hole in a desk.</p>
<p>Drama. Melodrama. That&rsquo;s one of the girls from Ipoh<br />Not to sink so low, and mention Michelle Yeoh,<br />Who also Escaped <br />Mrs. Raj&rsquo;s History Class<br />With James Bond<br />  No Less</p>
<p>Because Tommorow Never Dies<br />History Never lies.</p>
<p>So many of us go! Love song!<br />It seems so wrong!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily, you know. History is about old <br />Souls, not our rice bowls, learn all you can<br />Spread yourselves out <br />Become a Red Chinese Fan<br />  Find another land&hellip;.</p>
<p>The Bell  Rang.&nbsp; </p>
<p>History Test is Tommorow, alright GOOD LUCK,<br />said Mrs. Raj, her voice slipping like sand<br />  In an hourglass, I am leaving THE HISTORY</p>
<p>CLASS. </p>
<p>&nbsp;And You, pull up your  socks, don&rsquo;t be lazy<br />Or the facts will be hazy.<br />Don&rsquo;t Go Outside The Class&rdquo; said Mrs Raj,<br />Asking another girl to carry our books<br />  To the garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go outside the classroom, Teacher! <br />I&rsquo;ll stay here and wait for the bridegroom<br />  Mr. Wang is teaching the next class&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls are getting as bold as brass. Don&rsquo;t think I <br />Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; she said, lifting her eyebrows, &ldquo;What <br />You are doing outside<br />  THE CLASS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We, the locals, find this funny and laugh.<br />History for us, like the cannons, is a blast.</p>
