              <p align="left"><strong><em>for Rabindranath Tagore</em></strong></p>
              <p>I will not sit with disheveled hair, myself, unconscious<br />
                of the grounds I tread, Tagore; the burning desire of man<br />
          wrenches not only your book of poems from my hand. </p>
              <p>The dreams I had full flower in the languor of the night <br />
                fall scattered without safe arbor, my faith falters &ndash;<br />
          We live in a world another poet says no poor man </p>
              <p>ever picked his way out of. Life forces. This part &ndash;when<br />
                I am dragged by my hair- I turn the television off. <br />
  <em>a loveless union  ends&nbsp; where poems never end</em>. Bruised,  these lips.</p>
              <p>Close like a purse. Like a foreign tongue women and children<br />
                are wrung. On either side of the temple I press mine hands.<br />
                Your poems are a jeweled comb on these dessert sands. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                Once the satellite dish goes up, they drink it in. Now. The<br />
                four corners of the prayer mat are too narrow to live on. <br />
          The four corners of the world are too wide not to sin on.</p>
              <p><em>but the gateway to  heaven is everywhere</em><br />
                  <em>but the gateway to  heaven is everywhere</em><br />
          <em>but the gateway to  heaven is everywhere</em></p>
              <p>I will not look for another glowing city to burn. Neither<br />
                Mecca nor Madurai will burn in the fires of disaster<br />
          I will not look for the Nazarene or set my eyes, like oil  lamps</p>
              <p>At the doors of wastelands. There are no kings or lovers<br />
                In Isreal or Palestine  of whom to ask justice, a portion<br />
          equal to two females for one is <em>too much </em></p>
              <p>&nbsp;I am either taken out  of man or belong in hellfire <br />
                When God brings me laughter, like a cup of cold<br />
          Water, I will open my mouth to their utter disgust</p>
              <p>Pour your poems out, like a spout. Then clad in black<br />
                Like oil, these nine parts of desire will come unhinged<br />
          The river will run nubile. I will run naked and drown </p>
              <p>the crescent moon, two or three or four times.</p>
