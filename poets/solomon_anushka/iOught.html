              <h1 align="left">  I Ought</h1>
              <p align="left">for Margaret Hassan, Care International  aid-worker murdered in Iraq 
                written after a Christmas Party at the  historic Brown Palace,  Denver, Colorado,  in my capacity as a corporate wife. </p>
              <p>I ought to be happy in  an evening dress.<br />
                I ought. I ought.<br />
                Even as the battle in  Fallujah &amp; Baghdad is fought. <br />
                Even as I count the  cost of warring<br />
                Even as Margaret  Hassan cries out:<br />
                I am lost.<br />
          I am lost. </p>
              <p>The dress in Foley&rsquo;s  was marked down as I waited.<br />
                The death is  scandalous. <br />
                They will not write  about her: the martyr<br />
          She was nine parts of  our desire.</p>
              <p>In velvet, the night  stole across her shoulders<br />
                The dress drops in  tiny beads around her neck.<br />
                They will not say for  a glimpse, the men have <br />
                leapt across the  boulders. To retrieve the jewels<br />
                Plunged between her  breasts, they were crushed<br />
                luminescent. They will  not say silk spitefully<br />
                beckoned the men,  seduced them with a trailing<br />
          hand. For a price, her  midriff has been reckoned.</p>
              <p>Omniscient.  I think not.<br />
                Gandhi&rsquo;s spinning  wheel <br />
                is not unfurling a  single<br />
                flag. I think we are  all<br />
                equally lost. The men <br />
                dying for her, are  lost.<br />
                And those who are not.<br />
                Those who counted the <br />
                Cost. And those who  did<br />
          Not.</p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s not. It cannot  be.<br />
   A most Merciful God<br />
                The munificent Allah<br />
                The Alpha or the  Omega.<br />
          I don&rsquo;t see the door.</p>
              <p>Open mouthed I stare-<br />
                Arjuna, the cupboards<br />
          Of redemption are  bare.</p>
              <p> I am not Job, a righteous man<br />
                To talk. Only miles of  dessert<br />
                sand in the palm of  one<br />
                hand. The battle lines  are drawn<br />
                in tongues  to stalk her footprints<br />
                are hard to follow,  both hands<br />
                tied behind the back,  look!<br />
                in the winds of  tomorrow<br />
          I am lost.</p>
              <p>The evening dress I  bought is black<br />
                Margaret Hassan&rsquo;s body  is in a sack<br />
                The kick pleats are at  the back.<br />
   <br />
                What comes to mind is  not her pert behind. For a<br />
                Poem, I was resigned  to writing odes of beauty. <br />
                For a sermon, averting  my most lustful eyes, <br />
          Scrolling her slender  frame, I ask</p>
              <p>And where is that  beauty in a frightened heart? <br />
                And what lies ahead,  in a fistful of poems? </p>
              <p>Pull, pull out the  troops, please, please,<br />
                Make the war cease,  cease<br />
  <br />
                And in my heightened state of awareness<br />
                A state of grace  sadness, I roll my paper<br />
          And the pen across the  floor.</p>
              <p align="center">11 </p>
              <p>&ldquo;Margaret are you  grieving over golden grove unleaving?&rdquo;- Gerald Manley Hopkins</p>
              <p>Somewhere among the  dead poets, there is a fall<br />
                Among the colored  leaves of the manuscript, the <br />
                Nondescript men are  renting tuxedos&rsquo;, their <br />
          Women modestly covered  are waiting in the hall</p>
              <p>And Margaret Hassan,  are you there?<br />
                Somewhere beyond the  words engraved in cement<br />
          Does your soul dressed  in shades of green satin, lament</p>
              <p> &lsquo;Where is the man who can ease a heart like a  satin dress?&rdquo;-Dorothy Parker</p>
              <p>There is no more or  less pain<br />
   I don&rsquo;t know who gets more or less wet in the  rain.<br />
   I ought to be happy wearing an evening dress,<br />
                I ought,<br />
                I ought.<br />
          It will be something  to write about.</p>
              <p> </p>
