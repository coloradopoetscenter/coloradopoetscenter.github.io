  <h1>Cleansing in Colorado </h1>  <p>There is  a cleansing–<br /> Some might say of evil<br /> in this muddy wash that careened<br /> down the canyon;<br /> a torrent that scoured homes and cars<br /> down a liquid roadway of death.<br /> Unstoppable. Uncontrollable.<br /> Unbecoming of nature herself.<br /> But–<br /> There is  a cleansing–<br /> of which we cannot understand.<br /> The hand of God played against<br /> the hand of man. A futile gesture<br /> to believe &ldquo;we&rdquo; can contain the unthinkable.<br /> Now not much is left.<br />  But–</p>  <p>There is  a cleansing–<br /> in places once deemed safe.<br /> We were wrong or maybe <br /> ignorant; respectful yet cavalier. <br />&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t happen again.<br /> At least, not so soon.&rdquo; Scars once healed<br /> torn open anew; painful and deep.<br /> But–</p>  <p>There is  a cleansing–<br /> As the sun finally parts<br /> the clouds. Too much rain was days ago<br /> yet still they cried their tears into the river<br /> now swollen and brown. What must we endure<br /> except that which we create in concert<br /> or opposition? Only the earth truly understands and<br /> seems not to care.<br /> But–</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>There is  a cleansing<br /> of river and sky, of&nbsp;towns<br /> and homes, of life and lives which<br /> we may never comprehend–or<br /> possibly don&rsquo;t want to. Grief,<br /> despair, anger, and loss; possibly without<br /> ever moving beyond.<br /> But–<br /> There is  a cleansing–<br /> in anguish through time<br /> that never heals, like a child&rsquo;s tantrum<br /> ignored, returned with vengeance on<br /> anyone nearby. Now passed–<br /> energy exhausted, but for it&rsquo;s thunderous, <br /> rolling destruction. Landscapes<br /> forever changed, the shadows of history demolished.<br /> But–<br /> There is  a cleansing–<br /> of which I hope to never<br /> witness&nbsp;again.</p>
