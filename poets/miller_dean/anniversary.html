  <h1>The Anniversary </h1>  <p>It snowed today–<br /> on our anniversary.<br /> It&rsquo;s the first I can remember.<br /> The snowfall–not<br /> our anniversary.</p>  <p>Which means I&rsquo;ve <br /> simply forgotten the others.<br /> The snowfalls–not<br /> the anniversaries.</p>  <p>Each flake lingers–<br /> unique moments of our past.<br /> Drifting into memories<br /> of You and I together.<br /> Frosting our dreams; <br /> then melting streamside.<br /> Becoming something new;<br /> still a part of us.</p>  <p>&nbsp;The river of our lives;<br /> flowing to a destination <br /> we cannot see.<br /> Along the way<br /> new tributaries are formed,<br /> while&nbsp;others run dry.</p>  <p>&nbsp;Someday<br /> we will reach the sea<br /> and dance upon the sand.</p>
