  <h1>The Retirement Villa </h1>  <p>There was a time in my life<br /> when old meant 30.<br /> Cares were free, life was full,<br />  and responsibility–a far–off dream.</p>  <p>Then things changed in my life<br /> and old meant 70.<br /> Cares were present, life was full,<br />  and responsibility–an accepted challenge.</p>  <p>Then came a time in my life<br /> when old meant nothing.<br /> Cares were free, life was empty, <br /> and responsibility–a yearning long faded.</p>  <p>Then to dream of youth<br /> and days gone by<br /> seemed all that was left-<br /> except<br /> to die.</p>
