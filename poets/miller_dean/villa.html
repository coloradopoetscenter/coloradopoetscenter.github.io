          <h1>The Retirement Villa          </h1>
          <p>            There was a time in my life<br />
            when old meant 30.<br />
            Cares were free, life was full,<br />
          and responsibility–a far–off dream.</p>
          <p>Then things changed in my life<br />
            and old meant 70.<br />
            Cares were present, life was full,<br />
          and responsibility–an accepted challenge.</p>
          <p>Then came a time in my life<br />
            when old meant nothing.<br />
            Cares were free, life was empty,       <br />
            and responsibility–a yearning long faded.</p>
          <p>Then to dream of youth<br />
            and days gone by<br />
            seemed all that was left-<br />
            except<br />
            to die.</p>
