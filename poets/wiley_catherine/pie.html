<h1>The Pie Eating Contest</h1>
<p>happens at the county fair, late summer<br />when the corn has tasseled, husks<br />near bursting. Men alone compete; <br />they have red hair or yellow, freckles,<br />and the rivets on their jeans leave circles<br />on pink skin. Their hands are tied<br />  behind their backs.</p>
<p>The stack of pies- peach, blackberry,<br />apple, chocolate and banana creme, lemon,<br />rhubarb, pumpkin, lime, walnut, raisin, coconut,<br />cherry, and pecan-is overseen by women<br />wearing aprons and stern haircuts, <br />who see to it that no crumb, no slick of juice<br />  persists before the next plate is doled out.</p>
<p>A gun shot, the contestants bow<br />their heads over the bare planks<br />laid on sawhorses, buckled from the weight <br />of all those pies. Bibs crease,<br />lattice crusts are smashed, and the work<br />  of filling up begins.</p>
