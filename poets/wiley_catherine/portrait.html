<ul><li><a href="#">Biography</a></li></ul><h1>Portrait with Bread and Cat </h1>
<p>She's turned her head, so what the camera shoots<br />is half a face-large nose, dark curls, a fist<br />of bread. Dress stretched over knees, stockings<br />slumped, she sits on concrete, hunched or lumped,<br />the cat alert on its hind legs beside her.<br />It wears an unexpected rhinestone collar,<br />is poised to spring beyond the frame. A domed<br />church is in the background, like a great<br />square layer cake, its dollop of meringue <br />  stiff above the crumbled paving stones.</p>
<p>This woman could be anyone but she's<br />herself, as nameless as a soldier, stuck<br />in a smudge of newsprint, bread suspended.<br />Can her country be the world when her scrap<br />of the planet has been shaken, a rug left out<br />to air? She might be wondering how to sweep<br />her kitchen now the broom's regular corner<br />has been mortared; where they've drawn the border<br />this time; if the cat will choose to stay, <br />  or when the second loaf will come her way.</p>
