          <h1>Dog Gospel</h1>
          <p>When  I dare at last to imagine hunger, <br />
            I see a farmer wandering his  parched fields <br />
            knowing nothing to do, finally, but  sleep <br />
            the day out in the barn’s long shadow, <br />
            dreaming of the family dog he drove <br />
            deep into a neighboring county <br />
            and abandoned by the side of the  road.<br />
            Weeks later a boy finds it in a  ditch— <br />
            timid and gimp, a halo of gnats <br />
            festering between its swollen  testicles <br />
            and wormy flanks—and he coaxes it <br />
            into some pines, tethers it with a  tentstake <br />
            and a chain as the late summer  light <br />
            spirals and drapes over the  branches, <br />
            a mirage the dog slavers and snaps  at. <br />
            Consider the boy’s amusement <br />
            as he imagines the animal jerking  the light <br />
            down and the ruckus of bells that  clang <br />
            and catapult from the treetop  belfries, <br />
            the canopy rent like a piñata,  spilling licorice<br />
            and circus peanuts, coins and  fluttering dollar bills. <br />
            The real possibilities are beyond  him. <br />
            The dog as a parable of pain or  loss. <br />
            Hunger as some small iridescent  thing at work <br />
            inside the animal, hovering around  its heart <br />
            the way a lone dragonfly skirts the  dry pond crater, <br />
            dismantling the day—light  unstitched <br />
            from dust, dust unbuckled from  air.  <br />
            By now, the dog’s given up, and the  boy <br />
            watches its tongue loll in the pine  needles, <br />
            the heave and fall of its stomach,  its eyes <br />
            following birdflight in and out of  the shade. <br />
            Restless for something he cannot  name, <br />
            he imagines the music he might make <br />
            if he thumped the dog’s belly like  a drum. <br />
            Imagines its eyes are the color of  iron. <br />
            Imagines the unimaginable and does  it, <br />
            the tire tool and the belly  unwilling instruments, <br />
            and the dog’s caterwaul is not like  music <br />
            at all and when night comes the  cricketsong <br />
            dulcifies nothing, the dog’s body <br />
            is just a body, is not paltry, is  not glorified. <br />
            What hunger is this that haunts the  boy,<br />
            that haunts the man sleeping in the  shade?<br />
            Watch as the dragonfly dips into  his open mouth <br />
            and keeps going, a blur between  bone and sinew, <br />
            a wet thread collapsing soft  caverns of flesh, <br />
            gone to where his body is a field <br />
            honed by sleeves of sunlight, <br />
            to where the boy ceases to be and  the man wakes. <br />
            He knows what flits through him now <br />
            keeps the time with its thrumming, <br />
            carrying him away from himself <br />
            into himself, to where the dog  roves in the shadows—<br />
            ravenous, luminous—its tail bobbing <br />
          in the heat, a winnowing sliver of  light. </p>
