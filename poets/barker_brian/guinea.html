  <h1>Guinea Pig Gospel</h1>  <p> (Tuskegee, Alabama)</p>  <p>Out of mildewed files, out of  charts <br /> burnt by the blind god of  Indifference and Mistakes, <br /> out of a tainted petri dish and a  drawer <br /> strewn with syringes, I rise  tonight <br /> and sail on my paper robe <br /> to where the stethoscopeâ€™s cold drum <br /> hovers over the taut chests of the  sleepers. <br /> Honorable Members of the Committee <br /> of Ends and Means, take note of me  now. <br /> Once upon a time I was young and  poor. <br /> I laughed. I dreamed. I danced. <br /> I slept naked in a field listening  to bullfrogs <br /> bark in the distance, while my  blood <br /> coursed the length of my  fingerbones <br /> and pounded against my skull, my  neck, my heart <br /> like a thousand gilded hammers.<br /> What foolishness, you think. <br /> What dogs did I wallow with, you  wonder. <br /> It is true. We are all only human, <br /> and I have paid the price of a  multitude, <br /> of my race, of the sick and  exploited, of my children <br /> born in the gray muck of my illness <br /> and buried beneath the blighted oak  behind the smokehouse.<br /> Ladies and Gentlemen, here is  Exhibit X, <br /> my body the bacteria infiltrated, <br /> little flotillas colonizing flesh  and blood. <br /> Here are the smoldering chancres,  the rashes <br /> that rose then flared out like  cities, <br /> sprawling into the suburbs the  doctors returned to each evening. <br /> They slept in clean beds and their  silence <br /> filled windows and closets,  bathtubs and sinks, <br /> spread over swept lawns and spilled  into the sterilized streets, <br /> drifted up through pines to the  stars <br /> that glistened like sugar pills, to  the moon <br /> lacquered with the sweat of my  fever, <br /> its icy beam smoking on roofs that  could be anywhere. <br /> Here is the cure locked away in a  cabinet <br /> without a key, marked with a label <br /> I could not read, a warm square of  sunlight<br /> that never touched my forehead.<br /> Here are the guinea pigs that ate  and got fat<br /> and rolled in cedar chips, left to  their fate, <br /> and the delirious swine I carried  with me <br /> to death, thrashing against the  walls of my body, <br /> the fortified hold of a ship. <br /> And here is my spine, a broken  ladder of light <br /> on the floor of the sea that swells <br /> and rages in each of us, <br />  our passage not over, but just  begun.</p>
