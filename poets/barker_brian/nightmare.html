          <h1>Nightmare for the Last Night on Earth</h1>
          <p>Through  the hole in the back of my head<br />
            I could  see the room—<br />
            a metal  bed, hooks, a pulley, a tub of water.</p>
          <p>The  light flickered—<br />
            fissured, vertiginous, <br />
            as if a  Ferris wheel churned <br />
            inside  the cement wall.</p>
          <p>In the  shadows, a hooded man handcuffed to a radiator.<br />
            He was  sprawled in a dark puddle. <br />
            He was  so small, he was disappearing, his ribs <br />
            glistened  like black grains of rice. . .</p>
          <p>I heard  chattering in the distance,<br />
            something  guttural &amp; moist, like an army <br />
            of worms  tunneling through the white screen of sleep, <br />
            their  soft beaks scraping the window pane. . .</p>
          <p>I opened  my mouth  &amp; nothing came out—</p>
          <p>This was  the last acquiescence:<br />
            my  silences rose to heaven like handkerchiefs on fire.</p>
