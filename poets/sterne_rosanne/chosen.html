<h1>a  life chosen</h1>
<p>the  sucked dryness of being a mother,<br />this  feeling of rice paper thinness,<br />from  giving and giving<br />and  giving again,<br />ears  curled inward like<br />dried  mushrooms from listening,<br />arms  rubber-stretched from offering comfort,<br />breath  weak from telling and reminding,<br />fingers  wilted like coleus<br />from  cooking and patting,<br />voice  crackling from <br />just  one more bedtime tale,<br />this  profound exhaustion<br />leaving  nothing left to exhale &ndash;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of this<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a privilege.</p>
<p>like  the poems not written,<br />paintings  foregone,<br />music  not sung,<br />while  engaged in the process<br />  of  sculpting lives.</p>
<p>if  only to be replenished<br />by  drinking passionately of<br />the  warm perfumed wind,<br />song  of a blackbird,<br />morning  glory blue of the sky,<br />quietly  listening to the brilliant aria<br />offered  up by the sun-orange poppy<br />next  to still boulders<br />and  the hush of the blanketing surf<br />  over  a deep sleep.</p>
<p>and  later,<br />after  returning<br />to  smaller bodies shifting and shining,<br />to  tiny voices not unlike my own,<br />i  will find they are writing the poems my father <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frightened from me, in words i never could  use,<br />singing  the songs that were stilled from my voice,<br />and  painting an elaborate portrait<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in colors i never imagined. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosanne Sterne</p>
