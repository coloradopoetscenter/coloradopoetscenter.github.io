              <h1>tautology</h1>
              <p>You travel to distant lands seeking stable truths  and mystical philosophies to anchor your mind in the midst of man&rsquo;s chaos.&nbsp; You believe you can be magically led to the  ultimate source of inspiration, that pure, illusive and most distant spring  from which you will drink to nullify your own emptiness.&nbsp; You dismiss the exotic in the ordinary,  discount your own culture as plain, inadvertently abetting its decline.&nbsp; Blind to the lovely gleam on the varnished  floor below your own feet, the surface made lustrous by devoted domestic  repetitions, you laud process while secretly lusting after product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeking the sacred in otherness, you miss  the divine curve of elbow, scent of sun warmed skin, lapis shadow reaching out  gracefully from the underbelly of a ripe peach.&nbsp;  Claim process as your practice, for if you do not sanctify the daily,  you will receive life&rsquo;s ultimate product &ndash; death &ndash; with empty hands. </p>
