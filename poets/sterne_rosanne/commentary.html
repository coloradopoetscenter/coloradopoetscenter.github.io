<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Firmly grounded in image and  metaphor, Rosanne Sterne's&nbsp; poetry takes us&nbsp; below the surface of  everyday life to reveal the extraordinary beauty in the simplest of ordinary things.&nbsp;  Her poems are sometimes joyous, sometimes poignant, mostly meditative and  always thought-provoking.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p> Judith  Toler<br />  Poet and Professor <em>Emeritus</em> of English</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Rosanne Sterne illuminates us  with song.&nbsp; She inhabits her words with  the luminosity of a master artist.&nbsp; She  entreats us with hope, prophesies, the joys and passions of a life lived full  of vibrant memories and unexpected creations for each of us who travel with  her.&nbsp; Join her and be refreshed.&nbsp; Join her and be nourished.&nbsp; Join her and be loved.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>James  McGrath<br />  Author of <em>At the Edgelessness of Light</em>, <em>Speaking  with Magpies</em>, and <em>Dreaming Invisible  Voices</em></p>
