            <h1>Stunned by my Skin's Warm Reception</h1>
            <p> Blue spruce are having ideas everywhere </p>
            <p> in twilight. And ponderosa, their voluptuous </p>
            <p> cones strewn like hives where </p>
            <p> queens could emerge. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p> Perhaps drawn by my torpor, perhaps </p>
            <p> loitering from the day&rsquo;s heat </p>
            <p> the bees interrupt our first time </p>
            <p> on the cedar deck insinuating their </p>
            <p>hum into dusk. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p> <em> I thought they disappeared with the sun.</em> </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p> In noon light their lust can&rsquo;t get enough: </p>
            <p> coral, lupine, poppy, delphinium </p>
            <p>now they turn to me. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em> They don&rsquo;t like white</em> I remember from </p>
            <p> the beekeeper&rsquo;s daughter and consider </p>
            <p> myself safe in my alabaster linen shirt until </p>
            <p>three of them, intrude and </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p> I am stunned by my skin&rsquo;s warm reception. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em> Bees of the invisible</em></p>
            <p> the poet called them </p>
            <p> and they are tempting me to be </p>
            <p> authentic, my skin the skin of an </p>
            <p> itinerant, feet bottoms tender from </p>
            <p> so many steps. What is happening is </p>
            <p> happening despite my lethargy or </p>
            <p>because of it <span class="space">and</span> </p>
            <p> I am ripe for change </p>
            <p>in the evergreen-now </p>
            <p class="space"> barefoot I snatch up </p>
            <p> xylophone, flute, improvised cake pan, chanting </p>
            <p> <em class="space2"> don-gha-boo</em><em class="space"> don-gha-boo</em></p>
            <p class="space"> in sync with this legerdemain: this humming, this droning, this slight </p>
            <p> <span class="space3">buzz-magic stinging me, waking me, sucking me from </span></p>
            <p><span class="space3">underground tombs and airless institutions
            </span> </p>
            <p class="space4"> this gracious winging (fresh as </p>
            <p class="space5"> my dear dead) </p>
            <p> this song I - before the bees - had lost. </p>
