              <h1>Lost and Found</h1>
              <p> Like the strand of pearls mama tossed </p>
              <p> across the room that night, little white </p>
              <p> zeros spilling like years on the drain board </p>
              <p> down the sink, into the Rushleigh Road living </p>
              <p> room, bouncing to the frayed love seat </p>
              <p> under the baby-grand she didn&rsquo;t play anymore </p>
              <p> through the hall to the bedroom armoire </p>
              <p> that consoled the silks she&rsquo;d stopped wearing. </p>
              <p> The house rained pearls that night she slumped </p>
              <p> on the bathroom floor, her five-year-old </p>
              <p> counting the octagon tiles, trying London </p>
              <p> Derry Aire in several keys to lull or wake </p>
              <p> her. Next day we tried to collect them </p>
              <p> in the live music box, some were </p>
              <p><em> deliberately hiding,</em> she said. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> At my wedding and other choice times </p>
              <p> pearls in each ear, at my throat </p>
              <p>a single strand. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> Mama, see, I found them. </p>
