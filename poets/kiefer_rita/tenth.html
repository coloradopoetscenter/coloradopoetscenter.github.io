<h1>Tenth Anniversary</h1>
<blockquote><p><em> Was I sleeping while the others suffered? </em></p><p><em>Am I sleeping now?<strong>- - </strong>Samuel Beckett</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Spinning an aimless globe in the geography </p>
<p> section at The Tattered Cover, sipping chai in </p>
<p> an overstuffed chair, I am hoping for <em>Happy Days</em></p>
<p> and <em>Godot </em>to dull the orphan&rsquo;s voice buzzing </p>
<p> a litany from last night&rsquo;s screen: <em>they passed by,</em></p>
<p><em> they thought I was dead under all that blood. </em></p>
<p> After the machetes, the birds that wouldn&rsquo;t stop </p>
<p> screeching, the road games of pick-up-bones </p>
<p> and ring-around-the-ribbons-of-flesh </p>
<p style="text-indent:30px"> the Red Cross lost count after a half-million, </p>
<p>after not enough body bags <span class="space">after the child</span></p>
<p> flew
<span class="space">out of </span><span class="space">thetreethatwassproutingwetrubies, </span></p>
<p> one, it seems, the colonel forgot to wash off </p>
<p> his finger in the hotel before negotiations with </p>
<p>the Canadian who recorded <em>those utterly empty eyes.</em> </p>
<blockquote><p>Estragon:<em> Do you think/God sees me? </em></p><p>Vladmir: <em> You must close your eyes</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Somewhere a woman is shouting: <em>do it,</em><em>do </em></p>
<p><em> as they say</em> but her husband&rsquo;s slack arm, </p>
<p> collapsed under the machete&rsquo;s weight, refuses </p>
<p> to bargain her for the children &rsquo;til his Tutsi wife </p>
<p> pleads <em>you must,</em> not knowing the little ones will </p>
<p> watch mama fall under daddy&rsquo;s blow then numb </p>
<p> more each time they visit him nine years in </p>
<p>the Hutu prison. But blood has its own memory. </p>
<blockquote><p> Vladmir: <em> Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake </em></p><p class="space"><em> <em><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em>or think I do, what shall I say of today?</em> </p><p class="space">&nbsp;</p>
