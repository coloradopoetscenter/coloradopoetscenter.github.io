              <h1>Creation  Story</h1>
              <blockquote>
                <p><em>&ldquo;in the beginning, the earth was a formless  void </em><br />
                  <em>and darkness covered the face of the  deep.&rdquo;&nbsp; -- Genesis</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>in  the beginning<br />
                the  mythic Madonna and child <br />
                were  still one&ndash;&ndash;inhabiting each other,<br />
          a  Mobius strip, molecule to molecule</p>
              <p><em>emptiness  mated to presence, life</em><br />
                  <em>to  spilt blood, matter inherent in the dark</em></p>
              <p>until  slowly they unzipped <br />
                the  paired DNA of their selves<br />
                hovering  over and around,<br />
          their  boundaries still kissing</p>
              <p><em>unlocking  the space between atoms, </em><br />
                  <em>between  cells, between stars</em></p>
              <p>slowly  they gathered momentum, force <br />
                from  the furthest corners of being,<br />
                until  particles spun with the energy<br />
          of <em>need</em> and <em>want</em> and <em>must have</em></p>
              <p><em>heat  of the neuron's pulse, shudders </em><br />
                  <em>and  sparks, liquid stirring, splash of acid</em></p>
              <p>in  the beginning<br />
                the  universal essence quickened,<br />
                compressing  desire within desire <br />
          within  desire, until pure thought </p>
              <p><em>let  there be light</em></p>
              <p>collided,  shattered into fragments<br />
                and  burned</p>
