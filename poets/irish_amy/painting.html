<h1>Painting In  the Key of Sea&nbsp;</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>&quot;Blue  and Green Music&quot; -- Georgia O'Keeffe</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Underwater  electric, seductively<br />Simple,  a kinetic message <br />  Singing  down the spine &ndash;</p>
<p>Pulsing  below the surface, precariously <br />Close,  blue-green currents<br />  On  canvas, beneath skin --</p>
<p>Ebbing  intensity, insistently<br />Turquoise,  sound swelling<br />  Quiet  rhythms past their river banks --</p>
<p>Ocean-colored  currents, relentlessly<br />Relaxed,  tangled and intertwined<br />  Brushstrokes  of sound &ndash;</p>
<p>Saxophone  swirling tides, deliciously<br />Liquid,  take a taste <br />  Of  jade-voiced water, wade in &ndash;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t  worry. I&rsquo;ll teach you how to swim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
