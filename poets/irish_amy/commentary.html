              <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>
              <p>&ldquo;Amy's poems somehow manage to balance great power  with simple elegance. They seem to do this by virtue of her attention to craft  and linguistic precision&hellip;yet she always reaches for the &quot;big&quot;  topics.&rdquo; <em>Wazee Journal</em>, <a href="http://www.wazeejournal.org/Issue2/index.htm">http://www.wazeejournal.org/Issue2/index.htm</a> </p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;In [her chapbook <em>Creation Stories</em>], Amy becomes a priestess of word and image whose  incantations launch us toward the journey into ourselves that we each must  take.&rdquo; MD Friedman, Internet Poets&rsquo; Cooperative, <a href="http://www.poetsco-op.com/">www.poetsco-op.com</a> </p>
