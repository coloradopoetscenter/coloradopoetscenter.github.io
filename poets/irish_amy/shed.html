<h1>Shed</h1>
<p>My  skin itches from the inside<br />out.&nbsp; At the bend<br />behind  my knees the flesh<br />  is  raw and itching.</p>
<p>My  waist from hips to ribs<br />is  red and tender.<br />My  back, where I cannot <br />  reach,  torments.</p>
<p>Nails  searching and straining<br />for  purchase, for<br />relief.  I scratch and rub and twitch,<br />  whispering  my plea: <em>stop, please stop.</em></p>
<p>But  my skin is pulled taut,<br />hot  from friction. I itch<br />from  the inside out,<br />  a  living scab across the wound.</p>
<p>I  am wearing my old skin,<br />my  old body, still,<br />and  it chafes. Burlap <br />  and  wool, coarse and rough</p>
<p>And  wrong. I am beneath all that,<br />still  sewn up tight. Still <br />itching.&nbsp; Inside me, <br />  something  itching to get out,</p>
<p>Ripping  and twitching<br />To  get out. Two sets<strong></strong><br />of  nails scratching at<br />  two  sides of a door.</p>
<p>Flesh  burning and itching,<br />the  skin of this world <br />still  closed. But<br />  soon  now, soon,</p>
<p>I  shed.</p>
