  <h1>Picture a point, then place</h1>  <p>the point on a line, imagine it  moving along the line.<br /> Let the point be my mother, A,  and the line be a hall in an airport.<br /> Let the point traverse the line,  the line ABÂ  where B<br /> is the future, a departure gate,  too far away to see<br /> though you may name it gate 67B.<br /> Let the line bisect a circle that  is the whirl<br /> of departures and arrivals,  people and machines, and air currents,<br /> and let her be the point in the  center. Then let her move<br /> as a firefly moves, and let her  be the light as a firefly is light, on, off, erratic,<br />  erotic, let her be the point of  light in the whirl.</p>
