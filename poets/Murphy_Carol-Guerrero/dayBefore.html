          <h1>Day  Before</h1>
          <p>My  father opens his eyes and asks            Is this death?</p>
          <p>He  fingers the arm of his wheelchair.<br />
            He  hears someone breathing hard, a raspy sucking.<br />
            Himself.  </p>
          <p>He  sees roses, sun,  our faces.<br />
            Air  strokes his pale hair, smoothes it back .</p>
          <p>No.                           We tell him no.</p>
          <p>He  says he has walked through long halls trying doors<br />
            in  a labyrinth.<br />
            Does  he seek the death room?<br />
            Earlier  he had called out       eyes closed    voice breaking open our quiet</p>
          <p> Did you lose me?  I thought you had lost me.</p>
          <p>In  this room, the rose garden at the VA hospital,<br />
            his  doctor offers to his mouth a wild strawberry from her garden<br />
            so  ripe my father crushes it with his trembling lips,<br />
            the  only food he takes, smear of red juice, summer sweet.</p>
          <p>Then  again       Is this death   he asks.<br />
            We  think it is death&rsquo;s <br />
            opposite,  this life         ours        our electric  bodies<br />
            leaning  into each other<br />
            in  the only room we remember.</p>
