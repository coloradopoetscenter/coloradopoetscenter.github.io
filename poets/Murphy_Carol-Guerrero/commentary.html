 </div>  <h1>Critical Commentary </h1>  <p>&quot;In <em>Table Walking at Nighthawk</em>, I find a deep virtue unique in American  poetry now, a virtue that is also a technique raised high: the Panoramic.  Guerrero-Murphy understands, and loves, the sheer scale of Time as it is lived  in increments, of Landscape as it is carefully traversed by fragile lives. This  is redemptive writing, a joy to know.&quot;--Donald Revell. </p>  <p>&quot;[This] fine first collection  creates a compellingly complex and lyrical world infused by ancestral, mythic,  and dearly familial voices that weave together the literary and the  intimate&quot;--Kathryn Winograd. </p>
