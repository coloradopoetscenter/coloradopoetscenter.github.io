  <h1>Imperatives</h1>  <p>Lucky leads  me from clover mound to clover mound, <em>more</em><br />  <em>more</em> he tugs on the rope.  I&rsquo;m gimping along on the ground</p>  <p>leaning  hard on his shoulder in order to breathe fly spray and horse.<br /> <em>More, more</em>, I breathe.  More horses, more summer, on and on </p>  <p>until I see  myself on my death bed, last sucking breath, speaking <br /> only  regret: <em>more wild  horses, sooner, younger.</em>  </p>  <p>This hunger  for more has led you and me, beloved, <br /> bitted and  saddled for the whole clichéd story</p>  <p><em>more sex, more children, more gingersnaps,  more meat,</em><br /> <em>more square feet, more uisce beatha,  more stories, more journeys</em></p>  <p>as if the  Big Bang had been a body in the dark groaning <em>desire</em><br /> not a voice  speaking <em>the word</em> or <em>light.</em> <em>Desire</em>, I breathe. </p>  <p><em>I desire to breathe more of Lucky&rsquo;s  skin</em>. <br /> Everything  on earth rises from this red horse hide</p>  <p>indwells  there and releases every kind of sea from salt to sweet <br /> and every  kind of dung and plant and stone.</p>  <p>And from  him, certainty also rises, a sudden hot wind:<br /> this day of  meadow grazing, sky gathering cumulus clouds, </p>  <p>this look  into my casket, this black universe stretching, everything <br /> desired is  right here, you and I are in clover, more than enough.</p>
