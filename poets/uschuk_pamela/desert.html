<h1>Finding Peaches in the Desert  </h1>
<p>They taste like a woman, you say </p>
<p> and bite deep into the sweet heat </p>
<p> squeezing through tender skin, </p>
<p> while I laugh, taking the fruit you offer. </p>
<p> We close our eyes and transport </p>
<p> this delicious host to our loves </p>
<p> flown distant as time in dreams. </p>
<p> You can never eat too many, I say and pull </p>
<p> another ripe peach from the desert tree. </p>
<p> It fills my palm, my mouth as I suck </p>
<p> the unhusbanded nectar. </p>
<p> It is delicious as stealing light, </p>
<p> such innocent grace, a holiday </p>
<p> from history and eternity. </p>
<p> We bare our breasts to sun </p>
<p> as women have done for centuries </p>
<p> beside the blue water pool at ease with rabbits, shrill </p>
<p> wasps, the shy steps of occasional deer, </p>
<p> while vultures funnel mid-heaven. </p>
<p> Struck dumb by sun cauterizing </p>
<p> the Sonoran sky that flings its blue skirt </p>
<p> all the way across the ripe hip of Mexico, </p>
<p> we feast on peach after peach, while </p>
<p> peach-colored tanagers, wet </p>
<p> green hummingbirds and the topaz eyes of lizards </p>
<p> attend our anointment. </p>
<p> When I wipe one quarter across my breasts </p>
<p> and down my stomach to my thighs, I </p>
<p> am amazed at the baked odor of love </p>
<p> rising from everything I touch. </p>
<p> This is our ceremony to alter the news </p>
<p> of troops that mass for attack </p>
<p> in the Middle East, to alchemize all hatred </p>
<p> and greed, whatever name </p>
<p> it is given by multinational interests. </p>
<p> There is no aggression in sharing rare fruit </p>
<p> priceless as the wide imaginings of sky </p>
<p> or the brilliant coinage of dragonfly wings. </p>
<p> Even squadrons of wasps and fire ants </p>
<p> armed with nuclear stingers turn </p>
<p> from attack to the pungency of this </p>
<p> ritual feast that celebrates love </p>
<p> in the desert stunned green by unusual rain. </p>
