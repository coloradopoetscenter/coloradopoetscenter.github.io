<h1>Scattered Risks </h1>
<p> for Max Uschuk </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Climbing sandstone&rsquo;s blonde shoulders </p>
<p> above the whitewater trance of the Animas, </p>
<p> my dog dances the irregular lip </p>
<p> where talus chips like millions of arrowheads </p>
<p> lacerating time into an avalanche of scattered risks. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Wind bullets my chest when Lu Lu leans </p>
<p> into my six year old nephew kicking </p>
<p> thin blue air as he dangles </p>
<p> his legs daring the slender edge. </p>
<p> I call him back before his daydreams drop </p>
<p> through the backs of ravens </p>
<p> charting the river&rsquo;s hunger. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Why does vertigo sting me most </p>
<p> when others rock close to the brink, not </p>
<p> when it&rsquo;s me whose loose footing </p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve never quite believed could hold? </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> My stomach implodes to ulcers </p>
<p> while I pray for my husband craning out </p>
<p> to take wide angle aerial photos of Durango </p>
<p> and our house in the spinning valley </p>
<p> a thousand feet below. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> While my family teases oblivion&rsquo;s horizons, I imagine </p>
<p> the full range of terrorized flight </p>
<p> into screaming air, </p>
<p> legs acetylene, feet flailing, eyes </p>
<p> signing regret and hopelessness </p>
<p> before the fatal crash against rock, </p>
<p> rock, rock, the cold splash </p>
<p> if bodies broken by the thrashing current </p>
<p> that carves Gateway Park. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Tracing the crazy path my family blazes </p>
<p> scaling crumbling stone above a river that refuses to learn </p>
<p> the many human names for misfortune, I know </p>
<p> there is no way to save them. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Below the cliffs, kayaks bright as stained glass </p>
<p> or toy bumper cars bash against boulders </p>
<p> braced against whitewater&rsquo;s appetite. </p>
<p> What do I have to lose, except the way </p>
<p> sunset frames those I love, holding their shapes? </p>
