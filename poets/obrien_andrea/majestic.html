title: Andrea Oâ€™Brien : The Majestic

  <h1>The Majestic</h1>  <p>Because the evening is warm<br /> and one day closer to the summer<br /> solstice, we make our way<br /> to the roof of the theater,<br /> climbing iron rungs that I cling to<br /> like Buster Keaton<br /> when I look down, then passing<br /> over the rooms where people lose<br /> themselves in front of shiny icons<br /> and when we reach the top<br /> we sit on gravel among empty<br /> bottles of Jack Daniels and Old<br /> Milwaukee and look beyond<br /> the building across from us<br /> to a sky where city lights blend<br /> into stars so that if we were careful<br /> to lose ourselves we would be unable<br /> to distinguish between the two.</p>  <p>(First published in <em>Wisconsin  Academy</em> Review)</p>
