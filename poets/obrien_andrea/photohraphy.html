  <h1>Photograph, Summer 1981</h1>  <p>In this one my sister is 20, our mother 42, <br /> one year away from finding the lump. Why must that be<br /> the time line? They pose on a chaise lounge<br /> in bathing suits, my sister leaning back<br /> into our mother. This is how Peggy learned to love <br /> the sun. When old enough, I—brash like that— <br /> splashed on oil and fell asleep outside. <br /> But I never tan, only burn, and this is a photo of them, <br /> not me. There are infinite reasons to envy <br /> your sister—for example, because you’ll never keep<br /> a memory of sitting with your mother as an adult. </p>  <p>When my sister saw the picture 25 years later<br /> she had forgotten it—how our mother touched <br /> her back with one finger, the others drawn,<br /> hovering like honey bees as if too much touch<br /> would mean pulling apart later like the raw <br /> and tender skin that sloughs from living layers. <br /> What mark lingers long enough? <br /> Not the color from their sun, nor the pattern <br /> left by the lattice of the chaise lounge—<br /> those red squares branded on their bodies.</p>  <p>(First published in <em>Miller’s  Pond</em>)</p>
