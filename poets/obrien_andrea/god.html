          <h1>In Search of an Ordinary God</h1>
          <p>Above all I want to taste<br />
            Christ baked in the wafer.<br />
            I want to approach the altar<br />
            without genuflection or holy<br />
            water. I want to burrow<br />
            in the empty space of scripture.<br />
            If I could still my desperate<br />
            and swaying body, if I could<br />
            shut my eyes to the world I love,<br />
            if I could mute my breath<br />
            long enough, would I hear God<br />
            crunching celery sticks? Would I <br />
            notice her braiding beads<br />
            into my hair for her daily rosary?<br />
            Would I find her in lemons<br />
            and cancer cells and crack<br />
            babies, among dead birds,<br />
            delphiniums, and human waste?<br />
            Would I recognize her sliding <br />
            between the constellations to sprinkle <br />
            the baneberry with lustral dust?</p>
