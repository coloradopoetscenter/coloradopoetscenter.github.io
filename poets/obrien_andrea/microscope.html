  <h1>Under the Microscope</h1>  <p>Our living parts become works of art, <br /> even the bacteria that cling <br /> to what is most vulnerable and dark<strong>—</strong><br /><br /> the skin, the winding thoroughfare that starts <br /> at the mouth. We are nomads who bring <br /> with us these living parts like works of art. <br /><br /> Look<strong>—</strong><em>Starry  Night</em> resides deep in your heart, <br /> and across my nail bed Seurat’s bustles swing. <br /> The places most vulnerable and dark <br /><br /> house our microbial masterpieces, which dart <br /> about and seek out company in clumps and strings. <br /> Our living parts become works of art, <br /><br /> especially the pathogens that cart <br /> disease from host to host. How else could we wring <br /> joy from this vulnerable vale in the dark? <br /><br /> Magnified, we discover the mark <br /> we share, the one that binds us in clumps and strings. <br /> In the living<strong>—</strong>and  the parting<strong>—</strong>we  learn the art <br /> of loving what makes us vulnerable and dark.</p>  <p>(First published in <em>Tilt-a-Whirl</em>)</p>
