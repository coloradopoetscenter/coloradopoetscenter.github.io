</ul> <h1 align="center">Button My Lip</h1> <p align="center"><em>Viewing &ldquo;A Field of Buttons,&rdquo; a  painting by Tom Rogers</em> </p> <p align="center">That creamy yellow one, I'm sure came from<br />&nbsp;my  lover's blouse -- she yanked it open to expose the<br />
tops of her breasts, puckered the button between  her lips,<br />
taunted me to bite it from her with my teeth.<br />  And so I, well, later --</p> <p align="center">Oh no! That slippery emerald green button washed  ashore<br />
in Positano,Italy, the day  after the squid fisherman drowned<br />  while trying to save his boat in the storm.</p> <p align="center">If only Lee Harvey Oswald had had a shirt that<br />
took too long to button<br />  too long to button.</p> <p align="center">You know that fire-headed dancer? She popped the  pink buttons --<br />
angrily ripped off and threw her costume at<br />  the choreographer who was sleeping with the male  lead.</p> <p align="center">Buttons. Who has the shirt the silver one  graced?<br />
Who buttoned up Napoleon?<br />  Who unbuttons, who unbuttons you?</p> <p align="center">Don't be fooled by the lavender one -- if you  slip<br />
through the holes you'll be smelling the  sulphurous<br />
breath of the devil and want to escape into<br />  that fetal pose inside the Virgin Mary.</p> <p align="center">What you don't smell in these buttons are the<br />
peaches we stole from the roadside tree in Yakima, Washington.</p> <p align="center">But, oh -- how sweet the aroma, delicious the  taste,<br />
my ears swelling in revelry when I pressed my  head<br />
to the button-less bosom of my lover and<br />  listened to the radio in her chest, all night  long.</p> <p>--James  Ciletti, 2006</p>
