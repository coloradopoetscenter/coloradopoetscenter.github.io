<h1>Old Pickup Trucks on Taos Streets and Sky</h1>
<p>Even on a short visit  to Taos, New Mexico,<br />you'll notice star  wheels blazing the night sky,<br />and old trucks, among  grazing horses in the fields,<br />trucks, parked beside  tan adobe houses, chugging<br />down the narrow  streets, like the red GMC<br />&nbsp;over on Santisteven Street, this guy's a real  chick<br />magnet, shiny chrome  grill, fenders clean and<br />  slicked back, probably  whistles at every skirt he sees.</p>
<p>Down on Valverde, that  dark green, bull-nosed<br />Dodge Powerwagon, big  nobby traction tires,<br />surely takes a break  every afternoon, swings the<br />saloon doors open and  stomps up to the bar<br />  to slug back two shots  of raw whisky.</p>
<p>That poor derelict  Studebaker sunk in creek mud,<br />sun-fire eating the  rust off the roof, moonlight<br />bleaching the fender  tops, wheels missing, but<br />doors sprung open, seat  springs awaiting<br />  this afternoon's  breathless high school lovers.</p>
<p>Bodacious -- that  patent leather shiny black<br />Ford, toothpick between  its teeth, wants to buy<br />you a drink or two,  swirl you across the dance<br />floor, tip his hat,  open the door for a midnight ride<br />  up to the mesa to count  the shooting stars. Yeah!</p>
<p>My favorite though  parks by the Arroyo Seco antique shop<br />that blotchy green '50  Chevy with merit badges<br />of dented fenders,  rusty tin side-boards once used to<br />break the wind for  head-high horses,<br />hauling hay, kids to  the picnic, firewood.<br />Ego secure, he'll  probably never replace<br />the missing headlight  rings, never paint over Detroit's<br />red primer shimmering  up through the fading green. One thing<br />  for sure though, he'll  haul home your groceries and refuse a tip.</p>
<p>Makes you want to think  about laying down a blanket<br />in the truck bed then  holding hands to count<br />  shooting stars, and  streaking truck lights, across the Taos  sky. </p>
