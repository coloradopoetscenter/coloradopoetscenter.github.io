<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>Jim  Ciletti, master poet, president of Poetry West, has been on the poetry trail in  Colorado since the early 1970's when he served  in the Poets-In-The-Schools project in Colorado,  Wyoming, and Arizona. He lives with his wife Mary, in Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>Jim  operates Aamstar Bookshop and sells antiquarian and out of print books at  Hooked on Books and over the Internet. Jim and Mary create La Dolce Vita, a  literary salon in Colorado Springs,  and for three years sponsored numerous writers, poets, and literary events.</p>
<p>Active in  the community, Jim serves on the Friends of the Library Board, chairs the Frank  Waters and Golden Quill Awards, and serves on the ABE arts in education awards  committee. Now, as President of Poetry West, he says &quot;my goal is to help  poets 'go public' and learn how to present their work and give better public  performances and workshops and to write poetry that is more accessible to  non-poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim has a  bachelor's degree in Philosophy from Loyola Chicago, and a Master's from Middlebury College's Bread Loaf School of English.</p>
