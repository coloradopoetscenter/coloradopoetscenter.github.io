<h1>Morning Doves</h1>
<p>At 6 a.m. the open  summer window carries<br />in the coolest breeze  and coo-est cooing from<br />morning doves on the  wires in the alley -<br />the coo-cooing brings  the morning to that grace<br />where bees and  hummingbird moths and butterflies<br />  all suckle at the same  flowers.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll be  watering new pansy transplants<br />when from right over  head, the coo-cooing<br />flutes down so you can  feel this magical<br />  transparent prayer  washing over you.</p>
<p>Looking down from early  morning sun-fire<br />you can see these puffy  breasted doves<br />dawdle along the lawn  in search of bugs<br />then see them so  closely you can feel<br />Christ's last supper in  the gentleness of their eyes<br />and St. Augustine's heart in their gentle heads,<br />  soft tuft of scalp  feathers, coo-cooing.</p>
<p>The priest at mass said  that when<br />we protect endangered  species<br />we are performing a  sacred act.<br />Now I know, and you do  too, why St. Francis,<br />compelled by no other  reason than their loveliness,<br />  opened their cages and  let the doves fly free.</p>
