              <h1>Uncle Joe&rsquo;s Onions</h1>
              <p>Right after mass and  holy communion on St. Patrick&rsquo;s day<br />
                with big snowflakes  fluttering onto his shoulders, Uncle Joe&rsquo;s<br />
                foot and spade were  turning over the earth in his garden.<br />
                With a sharp stick he  furrowed long rows of black soil<br />
                then drilled hole after  hole, and planted then<br />
          covered the white onion  bulbs. </p>
              <p>When spring rains kept  him in, he pulled back the curtain<br />
                and in his mind&rsquo;s eye  I&rsquo;m sure he saw the long white<br />
          fingers of onions  growing deep into the dark earth.</p>
              <p>By late April, he knelt  on one knee and tugged weeds<br />
                from between rows of  new green onion stalks.</p>
              <p>In early May, knowing  the work of sun and rain,<br />
                as only Uncle Joe could  know, he dug<br />
          his shovel deep and  turned out a few onions.</p>
              <p>First, holding them up  to the sun, then tapping loose<br />
                the dirt, he pulled off  the outer skin,<br />
                cut off the hairy  roots, and at the spigot<br />
          he washed the onions  and his hands in cold water.</p>
              <p>Up in the kitchen Uncle  Joe shook salt over an onion<br />
                lifted the onion to his  lips, bit, then chewed and<br />
                closed his eyes.  Smiling, he remember the<br />
                snowflakes, and  received his communion, again.<br />
