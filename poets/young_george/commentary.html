              <p>&ldquo;The humanity of this rare  combination&mdash;the healing art and the art of poetry&mdash;is here in abundance.&rdquo;<br />

              <p>&ldquo;George Young cuts to the truth of  experience and transforms it. These are poems in which the particular incident  glows, warming and nourishing the reader.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack  Coulehan</p>
              <p>&ldquo;A fine poet and excellent storyteller.  His poems are vivid celebrations of seeing and hearing; of the art, music, and  the healing word; of nature and medicine&mdash;rendered close up and compelling.&rdquo;<br />
