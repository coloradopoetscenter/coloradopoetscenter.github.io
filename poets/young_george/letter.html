<h1>A Letter to William Carlos Williams</h1>
<p>We know, Doctor Williams, you and I,<br />as we go<br />from patient one to next,<br />thumb<br />the rumpled charts, cough<br />nervously and look away from worried  eyes,<br />what<br />  we will see&mdash;</p>
<p>what is, is, and it is<br />just this: the<br />truth<br />of blood and flesh we wrestle with:<br />sheer, brute, singular,<br />  wounded&mdash;</p>
<p>ourselves.</p>
<p>(from <em>The Pharos</em>, Spring, 1992)</p>
