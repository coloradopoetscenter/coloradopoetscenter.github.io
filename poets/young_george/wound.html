<h1>The Wound Dresser</h1>
<blockquote><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&hellip;not  one do I miss,</em><br /> <em>An attendant follows holding a tray,</em><br /> <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;he carries a refuse pail,</em><br /> <em>Soon to be filled with clotted rags and blood&hellip;</em><br />(<em>Leaves of Grass)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flying back from Richmond<br />I invited Walt to come along. He took<br />  the window seat.</p>
<p>We talked<br />Civil War, about what I&rsquo;d seen:  half-filled ditches<br />  and worn-down, grassy parapets;</p>
<p>photographs of young men<br />lying in rows, backs arched, mouths  open,<br />  as if some rapture had taken them.</p>
<p>long knives and surgical saws<br />and little steel instruments in glass  cases.<br />  He told me of arms and legs</p>
<p>piled high behind tents;<br />of white skeletons unburied in the  leaves;<br />  of that distant sound, like tearing</p>
<p>paper, a thousand rifled<br />muskets, what killed so many men.<br />  Then he looked out the window</p>
<p>at America, 30,000 feet below,<br />the green squares, the silver serpentine  ribbons.<br />  I&rsquo;ve seen it all before you know, he said,</p>
<p>in my mind, this land, our land,<br />from Virginia to California. I dressed  its wounds.<br />  I grieved its flag-draped coffins,</p>
<p>I sang its songs, the very songs you see<br />in that book on your lap. I leaned back  and closed<br />  my eyes. When I awoke he was gone.</p>
