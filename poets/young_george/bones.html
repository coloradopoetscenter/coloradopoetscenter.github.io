<h1>The Bones of Oliver Hardy</h1>
<p>When found<br />they will turn out not to be massive or  ungainly,</p>
<p>but rather delicate,<br />like the steel girders inside a blimp.</p>
<p>At the Museum of Modern Man, the curator  will call them<br />&ldquo;a typical example of late Cro-Magnon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassembled in the basement, no one<br />will guess what they accomplished in  life. Perhaps</p>
<p>a warrior, a cowboy, a boot-<br />legger, a bank president, a thief, a  horn-swoggler.</p>
<p>No one will image<br />the bowler hat, the Hitler mustache, the  round face,</p>
<p>the baggy pants, or<br />that the bones are incomplete, being  part of a set,</p>
<p>the other, smaller collection of bones,  missing.<br />But you and I (were we there)</p>
<p>would not be surprised if late one night  in darkness<br />the sound of a yodel</p>
<p>drifted up the stairwell, or if, in the  dusty<br />basement, the bones rose</p>
<p>and commenced to dance, each foot<br />striking the floor like moonlight on a  new tin roof. </p>
