<h1>Praise  for Daniel Grandbois&rsquo; Writing</h1>
<p><em>These are works of  surpassing literary merit… some of the most inventive, restless and creative  fiction I have read in the last five years. [They] sustain contemporary  American fiction, even rehabilitate it, and to have all these works in one  place for readers of the future is to do a good thing for all who care about the  condition of prose writing in North America. </em>--<strong>Rick  Moody</strong></p>
<p>Unlucky Lucky Tales <em>is an ongoing explosion of witty references  and allusions, energetic retellings and rearrangements of stock narratives and  images, and—above all—constantly varying tonal approaches to the material and  constantly various strategies for release… Reading it, I think of the great  jazz improvisers or Angela Hewitt’s version of Bach’s “Goldberg Variations.”  Here is a plenitude, a world of effects and inventions, from a fine and mentally  agile writer… This is a book of imagination's plenty. Ultimately, it is a book  of wonder and delight. </em><strong>--Ed Ochester</strong></p>
<p><em>Perhaps Daniel Grandbois is  the love child of Rod Serling, HP Lovecraft, and Russell Edson. His prose poems  hybridize shards of folk tale, sci fi, wacky animism, derailed creation myths,  and surreal apocalypse. Each piece is a microcosm of hyped up postmodern  imagination, in which narrative mutates, self cannibalizes, self resurrects.  Wild contradictions and dizzying distortions of scale, morphology, and time  rule Grandbois’ world. Now a stain, now a termite queen, now a goat-man,  divulge their points of view. Kiss conventional reality goodbye and prepare to  have your brain rearranged, to enter a realm in which scintillating, nonstop  invention is god. </em><strong>--Amy Gerstler</strong></p>
<p><em>One is tempted to look for  precedents to his odd surrealism and verbal pranks, but it’s clear Grandbois  has staked out his own territory, one peopled with offbeat characters and  varied discourses. Amidst these shenanigans, hovers a crafty narrative presence  seasoned by years of experience. The wise fool, an old conceit of literature,  resurfaces, and he is of course Grandbois himself. </em>--<strong>Peter Johnson</strong></p>
<p><em>A celebration of language in  its purest form, exactly what poetry itself was supposed to be. </em><strong>--Best Experimental Book Listing 2008</strong>, CCLaP (Chicago Center for Literature &amp;  Photography)</p>
<p><em>The short,  interconnected pieces of </em>Unlucky Lucky Days<em> should be on the  shelf of every high school English teacher, every writer who’s sat and stared at  a blank page, and every reader who is looking for a quick laugh. Very, very  strange—in a good way, of course. </em><strong>--ABA, Next Notable Book Listing</strong></p>
<p><em>In a folklore-like fugue  that resembles a darkly humorous Jorge Luis Borges or Italo Calvino, Grandbois…  use[s] everything from animals to sentient pieces of paper to illustrate  metaphysically dizzying truths about the world</em>. <strong>--The Onion</strong></p>
<p><em>These are funny, bizarre,  moving stories—a pleasure to read. </em><strong>--Lydia Davis</strong> </p>
<p><em>Singularly original and  captivating… an important work of fiction that should transform what notions of  fiction may currently exist.  </em><strong>--Luis J. Rodriguez</strong> </p>
<p><em>A must read for anyone who  cares about the future of American Literature</em>. <strong>--Doug  Martin</strong></p>
<p><em>Animated by a  wonderfully droll and fantastical imagination, these little stories are  delicious. </em><strong>--Rikki Ducornet</strong></p>
<p><em>Grandbois is a master of the  double-edged word, of stories that both cut through the world like butter and  double-back to saw themselves to bits. </em>--Brian Evenson</p>
<p><em>A modern  space-time set of interconnected myths and stories… elegantly precise, graceful,  a work of art</em>. <strong>--Ed Sanders</strong></p>
