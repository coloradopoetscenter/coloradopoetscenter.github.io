              <p>I've lived in Colorado  since I was two. I went to C.U. Boulder for my undergrad degree in Psychology.  I'm halfway through my MFA in Poetry from Bennington College.  The book that Green Integer is putting out next summer is really a string of  prose poems tied together to make a narrative. It was written in Boulder during my college years and takes place in Boulder. There will be  several gallery exhibits of the woodcut prints from this book in Colorado and around the  country. There has already been one at a major gallery in Argentina. The  prestigious BOA Editions is strongly considering putting out the collection I'm  working on now<em>, Unlucky Lucky Days</em>,  though the manuscript is not yet complete. For more information, reviews of <em>The Hermaphrodite</em>, and photos, my  website is <a href="http://www.brothersgrandbois.com">www.brothersgrandbois.com</a>.</p>-->
