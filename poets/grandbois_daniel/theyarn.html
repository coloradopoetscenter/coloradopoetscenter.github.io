              <h1>The Yarn</h1>
              <p align="left">from Unlucky Lucky Days<br />
              (Book 2, Inanimate  Objects)<br />
          First Appeared  in <em>Sentence</em> #5</p>
              <p>A skein of yarn was unwound and  wound in the shy hours before dawn. Yarn is naturally nocturnal and achieves  locomotion by unwinding and then winding. This particular, purple skein would  have been fifty yards end to end, had a bramble not caught and kept a long  piece of its tail months before. Undomesticated yarn can live up to a year.</p>
              <p>Frayed by so many grabbing  hands (the rough textures it passed over), the aging yarn pulled itself along,  searching for nothing in particular, as that is what yarns do, except the call  of almost anyone at all.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Tell us your tale,&rdquo; a violin  spider obliged from its loosely woven web.</p>
              <p> The yarn stopped in its tracks and  laid itself out, as that is how yarns tell their tales.</p>
              <p> &ldquo;Leaves  one unsatisfied,&rdquo; commented the sharp spider. &quot;The ending is too abrupt.&quot;</p>
