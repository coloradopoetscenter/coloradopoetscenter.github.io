              <h1>The Log</h1>
              <p align="left">from Unlucky Lucky Days<br />
              (Book 2, Inanimate  Objects)<br />
          First Appeared  in <em>Sentence</em> #5</p>
              <p>Once upon a log, a human face was  carved. All the more striking as it was carved by a chimp. He&rsquo;d meant to carve  his own face, but his use of tools was limited. Plus, accidents will happen,  most always leading to things breaking. That was the chimp&rsquo;s experience,  anyway. Just look at how the protruding snout broke off here. And the prominent  brow ridge, which was still in his hand.</p>
              <p> The  chimpanzee buried the brow ridge inside a termite mound where he had gone to  look for food, but what interests us now is the log, which was not pleased.</p>
              <p> It barked,  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop at the face, <em>Panzee</em>! Cut  some fists and let&rsquo;s see if you can take it like a man!&quot;</p>
