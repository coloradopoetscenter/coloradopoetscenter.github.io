          <h1>Lethe</h1>
          <p>My father drinks from the spring of  forgetfulness.<br />
            <br />
            Through the stillness of an afternoon, awash<br />
            with reminiscence, he pauses,<br />
            relatives long gone rising to whisper<br />
            answers in his ear.<br />
  <br />
            In his dreams they call to him<br />
            for an accounting, to enlighten the living.<br />
  <br />
            The penumbra of his memory lumbers off<br />
            into far trees pulsing in the heat, while birds<br />
            levitate on afternoon thermals,<br />
            spiraling upward.<br />
  <br />
            Out there, he says,<br />
            beyond the smoky haze setting on the fields,<br />
            a barn is burning, fire consuming the cobwebs,<br />
            an ancient roof on the verge of collapse.<br />
  <br />
            The ropy egg whites of his eyes<br />
            puzzle over past yearnings unfulfilled.<br />
  <br />
            He says that he is uninterested<br />
            in comfort without the truth.<br />
  <br />
            Those of us who linger on may be rewarded,<br />
            like scholars in a library, or explorers navigating<br />
            the far tributaries of a flow<br />
            who may, at times, find the lost or the forgotten.<br />
  <br />
            Daily he walks a dark corridor for exercise,<br />
            pondering old photos framed on the wall.<br />
  <br />
            At the end of that passage is a door<br />
            where he will find the solutions to all riddles.<br />
  <br />
          My father is uninterested in comfort without the truth.</p>
