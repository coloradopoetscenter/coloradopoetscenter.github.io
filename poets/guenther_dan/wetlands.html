              <h1>A Walk in the Wetlands</h1>
              <p>Thousands of water  creatures hum through the pools.</p>
              <p>Transient jays shriek  at your shadow.</p>
              <p>We pass quietly<br />
                under the sacred  antiquity of the cottonwoods;<br />
                for this is where we go  to hide,<br />
                a journey<br />
                over logs and  millenniums of moss<br />
          to find what lies at  the bottom of this wetland.</p>
              <p>Here nature appears  haphazard,<br />
                incidental as the water  snake that blocks our path.</p>
              <p>Wading through growth  and decay<br />
                we feel blind to how  things connect;<br />
          and we will always be  interlopers to the frogs.</p>
              <p>They scatter into the  wet foliage, and, like us,<br />
                conceal themselves in  sublime associations<br />
          with the leaves.</p>
              <p>Bubbles of gas rise  through splotches of algae,<br />
                nature's dark  counterpoint<br />
                to the turbulent  plumage of the oriole<br />
          and the swift  iron-slick of the otter.</p>
              <p>We move slowly into the  coming night.</p>
              <p>Small fish dart into  hiding places<br />
                within the stagnant  water.</p>
              <p>The placid blossoms of  the water lilies<br />
                are luminous at dusk,<br />
          like lamps on the  water.</p>
              <p>(from <em>High Country  Solitudes, </em>1997)</p>
