<h1>When the Owl Came to Gunnamatta Park</h1> <p>This rainy night belongs to the owl roosting</p><p> above my porch,</p><p> the one holding a dying brushtail in a chokehold.</p><p>  </p><p> Like an eccentric old man</p><p> he arrived unannounced</p><p> to stake his claim on our neighborhood.</p><p>  </p><p> His presence signaled the occult to some,</p><p> a shape-shifter haunting the backyards,</p><p> or a golden-eyed conjurer looking for possums</p><p> wearing only a feathered cloak.</p><p>  </p><p> During the day he sleeps within the hollow</p><p> of a rough-barked apple gum</p><p> near Gunnamatta Park&rsquo;s remnant of bushland canopy.</p><p>  </p><p> And we wondered if his fragmented habitat </p><p> hid a beloved who heeded his moaning call,</p><p> a sound suggesting travel over long distances,</p><p> or extended periods spent in isolation.</p><p>  </p><p> Quite at home on our cul-de-sac,</p><p> he practices his conjuring repertoire alone,</p><p> perhaps waiting for an answer from the great beyond.</p><p> </p><p>  </p><p>Dan Guenther, Quadrant Magazine, June 2015</p> </div>
