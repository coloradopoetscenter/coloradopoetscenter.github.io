<h1>Life-Zones on the Great Divide</h1>
<p>You warn your daughters  to tread carefully<br />
through the  altitude-stunted spruce.</p>
<p>For just above us  bighorns are dropping lambs,<br />and here we must  maintain the equilibrium<br />  through attention to  detail.</p>
<p>When the high trails  shift, loosened by subtle change,<br />boulders crash by,<br />the ground quivers like  the belly of a cow elk.<br />&nbsp;<br />On the slope below, at  dusk,<br />the mule deer appear  lavender-grey,<br />where living with  uncertainty<br />  has made their step  delicate.</p>
<p>Your daughters move  down this Great Divide<br />and find the difference  in life-zones<br />  a matter of the  obvious.</p>
<p>You tell of the balance  to be found at each level,<br />how at the end of the  day<br />  it becomes necessary to  size things up.</p>
<p>On this boulder field<br />the pika's urine is  crystalline.</p>
<p>Pick up a lichen<br />and ten years breaks  apart in your hands.</p>
<p> (from <em>High Country  Solitudes, </em>1997)</p>
