<h1>The Spotted Colt</h1>
<p>It was the heat that  drove his lightning kicks.<br />
When he leapt the gate  his shoes struck sparks.</p>
<p>His dust <br />hung over the long  track<br />  like a spirit.</p>
<p>The runaway spun our  afternoon about<br />to wake a light wind<br />  who showed her slim  belly by turning up the leaves.</p>
<p>High summer,<br />mother of June's blue  hummingbird,<br />  ready me for want of  flight.</p>
<p>(from <em>High Country  Solitudes, </em>1997)</p>
