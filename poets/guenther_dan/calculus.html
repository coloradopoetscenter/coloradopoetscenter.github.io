<h1>The Calculus of Emotions</h1>
<p>The calculus of emotions begins with the moon.</p>
<p>The nature of time<br />in intervals and intimacies of touch<br />  is linked to motion.</p>
<p>I believe that the lunar curve holds the secret,<br />that the mystery is as it must be,<br />in the configurations of plants as they grow,<br />in the textures and colors of skins brought together,<br />  in the spike of a shooting star.</p>
<p>The evolution of how we will be<br />is an outcome that always happens<br />in the darkness of the night,<br />and our feelings hold the promise of the future,<br />  whenever we reflect.</p>
<p>I wonder if the matter of love<br />can be grounded earthward<br />in the rhythms that pulse through us<br />when we are ready to speed,<br />  in tune with illuminations and phases in the sky?</p>
<p>Here the formulas and solutions are uncertain.</p>
<p>And I believe that we are designed to move<br />across great distances,<br />that there is a process<br />  where we reveal ourselves in dreams.</p>
<p>That truth is still there, after all these years,<br />holding firm as a planet in an orbit,<br />  perennial and absolute. </p>
