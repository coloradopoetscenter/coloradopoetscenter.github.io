<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>In <em>To Tango with the  Dead</em> Shirley Kobar takes us into terrain that is inevitable for all humans,  and yet delicate language of this poetry helps us to keep balance within the  sorrow of loss. Indeed, we do better than keep balance as we dance with this  poetry from death back to life. Amid the dead grass, a grape hyacinth sends  forth its bloom, and the poet reaches out to open the “new leaves/ of your  eyes.”<br />
