  <h1>Haibun</h1>  <p>It was the summer of ripening peaches and my younger  sister’s struggles with inevitability as green nubs blossomed into peaches and  summer faded into waiting.<br /> My second visit to the Chicago area was for my sister’s  surgery. When she awoke it was simply a miracle. It’s difficult to formulate  words for feelings of sadness and wonder why her and not me. The summer in me  thinks of unfairness and fall well, is fall. Autumn can come any season even in  the heat of summer. We breathe and wonder where time has wandered and why an  apple falls from a tree. In early September we hiked Coyote Ridge. The sun  still summer hot, burned. Cactus found pockets of shadow on shale. We took a  break on a covered wrap around porch. The breeze was refreshing delight.  We heard barks in the distance, coyotes were  raiding the prairie dog town.  Tired, my  bones melted into the bench. The lion loped out from under me, stretched into  the slope black tipped ears, black tipped tail, tawny, sleek. There was  eternity …then he turned his head.</p>  <p>When sister ripens<br /> sleektawny  uncertainty<br /> pocket shadows stretch <br /> eternity in a stare<br /> summer of  your  lion fall</p>  <p> <em>Improv 2009</em> </p>
