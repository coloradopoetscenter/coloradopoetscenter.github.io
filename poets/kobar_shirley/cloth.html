          <h1>How Many Strokes of Cloth</h1>
          <p>does it take<br />
to remove silver plate from a copper&nbsp;&nbsp;tin frame?<br />
I rub the cloth over and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spreading<br />
silver&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on  whimsy of bamboo and flower</p>
          <p>remove silver plate from a copper tin frame<u>.</u><br />
            The maple syrup pitcher iridescent green<br />
            silver&nbsp;&nbsp;on  whimsy of bamboo and flower<br />
            fingers cramp clutching fabric<u>.</u></p>
          <p>The maple syrup pitcher iridescent green<br />
            Great-great-grandmother Mary Kane McCoy<br />
            whose fingers cramp clutching fabric<br />
            silver plated pitcher in a covered wagon.</p>
          <p>Great-great-grandmother Mary Kane McCoy<br />
            traveling from Pennsylvania to Iowa<br />
            silver plated pitcher in a covered wagon<br />
            with husband, Thomas, and their three children.</p>
          <p>Traveling from Pennsylvania to Iowa<br />
            imagination limited by youth&nbsp;&nbsp;did not dream<br />
            Thomas and Mary, Michael, and Ella&nbsp;&nbsp;-<br />
            dust in their lungs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food.</p>
          <p>Imagination limited by youth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did not dream<br />
            burnt bread&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bruises from rutted jolts<br />
            dust in their lungs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food<br />
            Ella coughing into her apron.</p>
          <p>Burnt bread&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bruises  from rutted jolts<br />
            husband fearing their leaving<br />
            Ella&nbsp;&nbsp;coughing  into her apron.<br />
            Mother&nbsp;&nbsp;father  brother sisters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond  the overland trail.</p>
          <p>Husband sweating their leaving<br />
            maple syrup pitcher iridescent green.<br />
            Mother&nbsp;&nbsp;father  brother sisters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond  the overland trail<br />
            How many&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does  it take?</p>
