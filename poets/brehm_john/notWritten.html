  <h1>The Poems I Have Not Written</h1>  <p>I'm  so wildly unprolific, the poems<br /> I  have not written would reach<br /> from  here to the California coast<br />  if  you laid them end to end.</p>  <p>And  if you stacked them up,<br /> the  poems I have not written<br /> would  sway like a silent<br /> Tower  of Babel, saying nothing</p>  <p>and  everything in a thousand<br /> different  tongues. So moving, so<br /> filled  with and emptied of suffering,<br /> so  steeped in the music of a voice</p>  <p>speechless  before the truth,<br /> the  poems i have not written<br /> would  break the hearts of every<br /> woman  who's ever left me</p>  <p>make  them eye their husbands<br /> with  a sharp contempt and hate<br /> themselves  for turning their backs<br /> on  the very source of beauty.</p>  <p>The  poems I have not written<br /> would  compel all other poets<br /> to  ask of God: &quot;<em>Why</em>&nbsp;do you<br /> let  me live? I am worthless.</p>  <p>please  strike me dead at once,<br /> destroy  my works and cleanse<br /> the  earth of all my ghastly<br /> imperfections.&quot;  Trees would</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>bow  their heads before the poems<br /> I  have not written. &quot;Take me,&quot;<br /> they  would say, &quot;and turn me<br /> into  your pages so that I</p>  <p>might  live forever as the ground<br /> from  which your words arise.&quot;<br /> The  wind itself, about which<br /> I  might have written so eloquently,</p>  <p>praising  its slick and intersecting<br /> rivers  of air, its stately calms<br /> and  furious interrogations,<br /> its  flutelike lingerings and passionate</p>  <p>reproofs,  would divert its course<br /> to  sweep down and then pass over<br /> the  poems I have not written,<br /> and  the life I have not lived, the life</p>  <p>I've  failed even to imagine,<br /> which  they so perfectly describe.</p>  <p>â€”first  appeared in <em>The Southern Review</em></p>
