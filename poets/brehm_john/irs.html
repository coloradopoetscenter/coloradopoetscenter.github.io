  <h1>Dear Internal Revenue Service</h1>  <p>Thank  you for your letter informing me of the errors<br /> in  my 2005 filing. I’m enclosing a check for<br /> $5,657.00  to cover the tax which I evidently<br /> still  owe and the interest on that tax.<br /> I  would hereby like to ask, however,<br /> that  you forgive the penalty of $1,136.00<br /> since  the employer failed to send me a 1099<br /> for  the income I made as a consultant that year.<br /> Of  course I realize it’s <em>my</em> responsibility to report<br /><em>all</em> my income, but in the  absence of a 1099<br /> I  simply forgot. I have a number of clients<br /> and  I’m (obviously) not the best bookkeeper.<br /> Nor  am I particularly “good with money.”<br /> I  am a poet as well as a freelance writer,<br /> and  being a poet isn’t quite as lucrative<br /> as  you might imagine. You may notice,<br /> for  example, that for all of last year I received<br /> $57.00  in royalties. (A friend of mine helpfully<br /> observed  that I could have made more money<br /> “as  a parking meter,” to which I replied that<br /> I  could have made <em>a lot</em> more money as a  parking meter,<br /> and  gotten <em>a lot more respect</em> as well.)<br /> Unlike  most hard-working poets in America,<br /> I  don’t teach, mainly because I don’t know anything.<br /> I’m  probably not all that far from the clichéd notion<br /> of  the romantic poet you yourself may hold.<br /> I  get stoned sometimes and stare at trees and clouds<br /> for  hours on end, try to see the wind, etc.<br /> I  weep for no reason, remember real or imagined<br /> slights  for ages, and lick my wounds with words.<br /> I  live in a studio apartment, a garret if you will.<br /> I  have a huge desk—it’s like the deck of a ship,<br /> and  I its landlocked captain, gazing out to sea.<br /> It  sits underneath my sleeping loft, which<br /> my  girlfriend likes to call “the lofty loft,”<br /> for  reasons I won’t go into here as they may seem<br /> inappropriate,  or too personal, or perhaps<br /> irrelevant  to my purpose, which is to ask your<br /> forgiveness  of the penalty and to offer reasons why<br /> by  explaining the hardships of the poet’s life.<br /> I’ll  just say that sometimes it gets pretty lofty up there<br /> and  sometimes we imagine we’re on a magic carpet<br /> drifting  smoothly above the city below, in its state<br /> of  semi-controlled, slow-motion collapse,<br /> and  on out over the ocean, which she loves and fears,<br /> just  like I do, or over the summer-campy Catskills,<br /> where  we can’t afford to buy a country house,<br /> with  their worn-down mountains and charmingly<br /> self-effacing  trees, so unlike the impossibly massive<br /> and  overly serious cedars and hemlocks and<br /> Douglass  fir trees of the Pacific Northwest,<br /> where  I used to live until poverty forced me East.<br /> Those  trees are brooders—dignified, mist-shrouded<br /> monsters—beautiful,  of course, and awe-inspiring<br /> (I  wonder if you have felt this), but too damply<br /> archaic  and imposing and uncomprehendable<br /> for  my taste. I like a tree you can take in with<br /> a  single steady gaze. I wonder if you are as bad<br /> at  poetry as I am at accounting. Perhaps we are<br /> the  inverted mirror-images of each other.<br /> I  don’t imagine you get asked that question<br /> very  often or receive many letters like this one.<br /> Maybe  you’re reading this out loud even now<br /> to  your office (I almost said “cell”) mates. Of my book<br /> a  reviewer once said that “one simply can’t resist<br /> reading  these poems out loud to someone else,”<br /> and  I wonder if you feel this—the irresistible<br /> need  to read this poem aloud. I’m sure<br /> the  letters you receive are mostly angry ones,<br /> the  kind that say things like, “Here, take my<br /> Goddamn  money and buy Dick Cheney a few more<br /> gallons  of puppy blood for his nightly ablutions,”<br /> or  “Dear IRS, please use the enclosed check to<br /> purchase  some hand-held rocket-launchers to blast the fuck<br /> out  of some poor Iraqi’s house, which you prefer<br /> to  call ‘a suspected insurgent stronghold.’”<br /> Or,  “Please give this money to the CEO of Exxon<br /> so  he can buy silk socks while I regurgitate<br /> my  supper and try not to starve.”<br /> I  thought of taking that approach, I felt<br /> that  desire to get in a shot or two, to give voice<br /> to  righteous indignation, treat you like<br /> a  non-person, someone mindlessly<br /> and  heartlessly saying “no” all day long.<br /> But  I’m done with all that, I want to reach you,<br /> to  speak to you as a fellow human being immersed<br /> in  the same joys and suffering as I am—didn’t you<br /> once  write poems yourself, poems of anguish<br /> and  loss and loneliness?—and to remind you<br /> of  the karmic delights of forgiveness that<br /> await  you if you release me<br /> from  this debt.<br />  —first  appeared in <em>Rattle</em></p>
