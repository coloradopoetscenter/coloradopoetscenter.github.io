  <h1>Getting  Where We're Going</h1>  <p>Surfeit  of distance and the wracked mind waiting,<br /> nipping  at itself, snarling inwardly at strangers.<br /> If  I had a car in this town I'd<br /> rig  it up with a rear bumper horn,<br /> something  to blast back at the jackasses<br /> who  honk the second the light turns green.<br /> If  you could gather up all the hornhonks<br /> of  just one day in New York City,<br /> tie  them together in a big brassy knot<br /> high  above the city and honk<br /> them  all at once it would shiver<br /> the  skyscrapers to nothingness, as if<br /> they  were made of sand, and usher<br /> in  the Second Coming. Christ would descend<br /> from  the sky wincing with his fingers<br /> in  his ears and judge us all<br /> insane.  Who'd want people like us<br /> up  there yelling at each other, trashing<br /> the  cloudy, angelic streets with our<br /> candywrappers  and newspapers and coffeecups?<br /> Besides,  we'd still be waiting for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> the  next thing to happen in Heaven,<br /> the  next violin concerto or cotton candy<br /> festival  or breathtaking vista to open<br /> beneath  our feet, and thinking this place<br /> isn't  quite what it's cracked up to be,<br /> and  why in hell does everybody<br /> want  to get here? We'd still be<br /> waiting  for someone else to come<br /> and  make us happy, staring<br /> through  whatever's in front of us,<br />  cursing  the light that never seems to change.</p>  <p>â€”first  appeared in <em>Poetry </em></p>
