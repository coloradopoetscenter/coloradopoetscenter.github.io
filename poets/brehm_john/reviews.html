  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>In the <em>Georgia  Review</em>, Judith Kitchen praised <em>Sea of  Faith</em> for its “unified consistency of tone and sophistication of approach,”  remarking that the “voice is urbane, humorous, and amused—distanced just enough  to poke fun at the world and itself alike, to be able to see the ironies in  every predicament.” Kitchen finds that Brehm’s poems give “voice to the  complexities of being, handing us back to ourselves through the surety of his  craft.”</p>  <p>In awarding <em>Sea  of Faith</em> the Brittingham Prize, Carl Dennis described a speaker who is  “both self-mocking and self-accepting, taking his concerns seriously but always  distant enough from them to regard them as a small part of a larger human  story, a story we recognize at once to be our own.”&nbsp; </p>  <p>David Daniel wrote in <em>Ploughshares</em> that “Brehm's poems are sexy, funny, often brilliantly  crafted, and wonderfully sweet at their core.” He called <em>Sea of Faith</em> “one of those rare books one can confidently recommend  to any friend, even those whose hearts are hardened to poetry.” </p>
