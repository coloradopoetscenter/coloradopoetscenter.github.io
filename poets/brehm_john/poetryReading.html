  <h1>At  the Poetry Reading</h1>  <p>I  can’t keep my eyes off the poet’s<br /> wife’s  legs—they’re so much more<br /> beautiful  than anything he might<br /> be  saying, though I’m no longer<br /> in  a position really to judge,<br /> having  stopped listening some time ago.<br /> He’s  from the Iowa Writers Workshop<br /> and  can therefore get along fine<br /> without  my attention. He started in<br /> reading  poems about his childhood—<br /> barns,  cornsnakes, gradeschool, flowers,<br /> that  sort of stuff—the loss of<br /> innocence  he keeps talking about<br /> between  poems, which I can relate to,<br /> especially  under these circumstances.<br /> Now  he’s on to science, a poem<br /> about  hydrogen, I think, he’s trying<br /> to  imagine himself turning into hydrogen.<br /> Maybe  he’ll succeed. I’m imagining<br /> myself  sliding up his wife’s fluid,<br /> rhythmic,  lusciously curved, black-<br /> stockinged  legs, imagining them arched<br /> around  my shoulders, wrapped around my back.<br /> My  God, why doesn’t he write poems about her!<br /> He  will, no doubt, once she leaves him,<br /> leaves  him for another poet, perhaps,<br /> the  observant, uninnocent one, who knows<br />  a  poem when it sits down in a room with him.</p>  <p>—first  appeared in <em>Poetry</em></p>
