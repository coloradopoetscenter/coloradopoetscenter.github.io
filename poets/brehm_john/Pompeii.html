          <h1>Pompeii</h1>
          <p>Standing on the subway, exhausted, dispirited,<br />
            glancing over the exhausted, dispirited faces<br />
            of my fellow passengers, I read posters<br />
            for a new movie about Pompeii.<br />
            “How can you breathe when the air is on fire?”<br />
            “How can you escape a boiling mudslide?”<br />
            “How can you outrun an eruption<br />
            faster than this train?” they ask.<br />
            Obviously the ad writer has never been<br />
            on <em>this</em> train, because  this is a Q train,<br />
            and anybody who can’t outrun a Q train<br />
            must be on death’s doorstep anyway<br />
            and will soon be overtaken by time itself,<br />
            if not a boiling mudslide, though sometimes<br />
            that’s what time feels like, thick<br />
            and burning, pushing you on and pulling<br />
            you back. And now we rise creaking<br />
            over the Manhattan Bridge, where<br />
            one can see through scratchy windows<br />
            the city skyline and the buildings that are<br />
            not there, where thousands tried<br />
            to breathe air on fire and failed,<br />
            tried to flee an avalanche of concrete<br />
            and falling bodies and failed.<br />
            If only they’d been asked to outrun something<br />
            as slow as this slow train that takes us home—<br />
            how easily they might have done it.<br />
            But that is not what they were asked to do.<br />
