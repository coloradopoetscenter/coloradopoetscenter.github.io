  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1> <p>This book is as big as India and as small as the breath it  takes to pronounce one of its words. When you open the door of its cover, you  enter another world which is a more vivid version of this one where George  Kalamaras is shaman, interior astrologer, cartographer of fantastic spaces.  Word-levitator and world-levigator. When you open this book, you enter the  sensual world of &ldquo;saris, kurtas, Banaras silk&rdquo;  while you simultaneously step into the spiritual core where Kalamaras has  &ldquo;Mapped an interior astrology / of ascent, altar of the spine.&rdquo;</p>  <p>His poetry is cantilevered, projected outward while reaching  inward into the wonder-lured and prismatic. Like the rich Indian landscape,  this poetry is erotically spiritual and spiritually erotic. Kalamaras provides  a dwelling where &ldquo;Something // is always burning and something / is always in  heat.&rdquo; And ultimately the reader engages through these poems the transformative  power of love/poetry, and with this comes the revelation: you cannot open this  book without experiencing &ldquo;the lover&rsquo;s tongue.&rdquo;</p>  <p>—Patrick Lawler </p>  <p>Stranger and inhabitant, taken by surprise, shocked by  recognitions, George Kalamaras has made his India into poems. In them, a man is  alive. Poetic energy runs and ripples through the text. His acute kinetic  descriptions and silences flash across everyday exotic<br /> events. The excitement of discovery is cumulative.</p>  <p>—Marie Ponsot </p>  <p>The name Kalamaras means, as everyone knows, He Who Channels  the Throat Songs of the Inflamed Detectives of Southern Surreality. He has more  language at his command than Peter Mark Roget, but though we recognize the  words, their electrifying combinations have never been heard before. Given  Kalamaras&rsquo;s impressively penetrating knowledge of English literature, and his  pendant for Asian poetry, Tantric Buddhist texts, and 20th century contemporary  international poetry in translation, the delicious eclecticism of the poems and  the velocity of their outrageously wide range of reference should be no  surprise. But the alarming fact is: they are as surprising as they are  addictive.  </p>  <p>—Forrest Gander </p> <p> At  times erotic, at times poignant, always passionate, Kalamaras writes with  tremendous physicality. His words not only bear the electric charge of a  heavily focused mind, a mind enthralled with linguistic muscle, that organ in  the head called a tongue, but as a practitioner of yoga he writes from the  perspective of a romantic fully engaged with the world. A romantic not in the  sense of a flamboyant Byron, though there may be a little of that evident, but  a Keats who has traveled to India  and worked his tongue into a pomegranate in the hot dusty streets of Varanasi, near the Ganges.<br /> —John  Olson</p>  <p>Kalamaras  laurels that part of freedom which knows no bounds except the crime of love.  Read him sideways, read him backwards. This is the mouth of a cannon that fires  at all conventional assumptions.<br />  —Alvaro  Cardona-Hine</p>
