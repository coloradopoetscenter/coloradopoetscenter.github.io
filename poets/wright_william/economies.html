  <h1>Economies of Scale</h1>  <p> </p>  <p>The first balloonists could wave and shout,</p>  <p>got stuck on chimneys like storks,</p>  <p> </p>  <p>disturbed and then charmed farmers,</p>  <p>took along the mayor and his girlfriends,</p>  <p> </p>  <p>and were so close and novel that they</p>  <p>could hear singing and drop presents.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Up here now we go unnoticed,</p>  <p>too far and too familiar,</p>  <p> </p>  <p>though perhaps someone can see</p>  <p>this small light something like a star</p>  <p> </p>  <p>in the dark above a rooftop</p>  <p>on the way home or back to bed</p>  <p> </p>  <p>out a kitchen window</p>  <p>through the limbs of a tree before dawn.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>(from <em>Cosmonauts</em>)</p>
