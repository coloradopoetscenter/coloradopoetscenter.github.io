<h1>The Month of the Dead
</h1>
<p><em>Quick now, here, now, always</em> &ndash;T.S. Eliot </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The dead like words </p>
<p>go out from us </p>
<p>into gardens and ponds, into cemeteries, </p>
<p>into newspapers in tiny print. </p>
<p>Even in silence they mark the progress </p>
<p>of grass, the lack of trees, the few </p>
<p>things that happen slowly to stone and brass. </p>
<p>Books stay closed, lists get shorter. </p>
<p>Ruby and Mabel name fewer old ladies. </p>
<p>Words and the dead like rain </p>
<p>soak into the dry ground. </p>
<p>It is not that people die so much </p>
<p>as that they do so on regular days, </p>
<p>May 23rd, August 12th, tomorrow, </p>
<p>taking those days forever with them. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is nothing to know where you are. </p>
<p>The old man still walks to where he once worked. </p>
<p>The difficulty is ever when. </p>
<p>The woman wears three watches in the airport. </p>
<p>In the snow outside </p>
<p>Pope Gregory&rsquo;s castle, was Henry waiting </p>
<p>just to ask the time, the date, </p>
<p>for a calendar that would bring </p>
<p>Spring back to Spring? </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we wait for, </p>
<p>when, a place to put everyone, </p>
<p>a day to cross off or set out in red ink&mdash; </p>
<p>dead now, there, now, always&mdash; </p>
<p>without the accumulated </p>
<p>birthdays and dentist appointments. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is only the small matter of lying </p>
<p>to make a month for the dead, </p>
<p>to set aside whole weeks </p>
<p>where no one meets or marries, </p>
<p>when no children are born, </p>
<p>a month away from other months </p>
<p>to say that those who are dead died then. </p>
<p>If we cannot find a month, perhaps </p>
<p>we can hold the dead to the days they died, </p>
<p>always Sunday if it was a Sunday, </p>
<p>the third Wednesday in July, </p>
<p>like Easter dependent on the moon. </p>
<p>Let them stay put while the anniversaries </p>
<p>of the living wander through the week. </p>
<p>Give us the peace of languorous summer months </p>
<p>and them a place both for when they&rsquo;d left and where they&rsquo;ve gone. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Words like the dead </p>
<p>contract and attach </p>
<p>to days of unexpected rain, to bank tellers, </p>
<p>to the background faces in paintings </p>
<p>and horizons out particular windows. </p>
<p>They mark the progress of hydrangeas </p>
<p>that sail through the California winter. </p>
<p>Words and the dead like leaves </p>
<p>crowd round what should only be </p>
<p>the hours we lay together in the grass, </p>
<p>the day the dog got out, </p>
<p>the Tuesdays full of nothing. </p>
<p>These one-time people, these scattered sentiments&mdash; </p>
<p>here now, gone, now, always&mdash; </p>
<p>we cannot gather them in, we cannot let them go. </p>
