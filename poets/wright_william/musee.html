              <p> after the Chagall exhibit I'm almost sure we'll climb</p>
              <p> onto the roof and call that florist who delivers anywhere </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> four still lifes and we're off to our favorite restaurant </p>
              <p> three Maillols and I need to sleep in your arms </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> if you stare at a Matisse for two minutes without blinking </p>
              <p> and then look immediately into a Gauguin </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> a woman with blue hair and a green dress </p>
              <p> will smoke cigarettes and eat papaya </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> the same with the Seurat </p>
              <p> and some of the abstract expressionists </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> if you can catch the elevator Christmas lights </p>
              <p> will bloom on all the Jackson Pollacks </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> I follow you around even at the risk of having </p>
              <p> to drum my fingers through all the complaints about your profile </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> I want to say &quot;hold still&quot; in the sculpture garden </p>
              <p> &quot;look up at the skylight&quot; to raise your perfect chin </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> and when I do wander off to the Sisleys or Cassatts </p>
              <p> you come up behind me at the Rothko </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> and whisper &quot;I'll be the orange if you'll be the yellow&quot; </p>
              <p> taking my hand as we leave the building </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> smiling as the guard looks at you and says </p>
              <p> to me &quot;where do you think you're going?&quot; </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
