  <h1>Little Bighorn</h1>  <p>You could be listening to jazz<br /> in a truck named for a tribe,<br /> bound for Big Sky, skis on the rack. <br /> <br /> Then you cross<br /> the storied river. </p>  <p>It&rsquo;s night and you&rsquo;re hours late,<br /> hours left to drive. <br /> Anyway, if you stopped, <br /> stood in the January <br /> wind, who knows what you&rsquo;d see,<br /> and are you ready for visions,<br /> for this particular horror?</p>  <p>The Little Bighorn Casino </p>  <p>flares and reduces to your rearview. <br /> Pause in your thoughts, what was<br /> extinguished here, <br /> who stood to the last? Look back:<br /> the bright casino lot is full<br /> of Cherokees and Dakotas.<br /> Turn forward: three times </p>  <p>the river cuts under this highway. </p>  <p>(<em>Originally published, in slightly different  form, in </em>The Externalist)</p>
