  <h1>Trajectories</h1>  <p>The Oregon Trail is marked in places<br /> By wagon ruts, and vegetation<br /> In clumps thicker and greener, <br /> Though indiscernible to the naked eye.<br /> With infrared, could you trace<br /> The trail from grave to grave?</p>  <p>When we built the new house, I left<br /> Our infant son beneath the lilac<br /> In the old yard. Who owns that home<br /> Now owns his bones.</p>  <p>Those children left behindâ€”</p>  <p>While the husks of their mothers<br /> Move on, and on, one foot,<br /> One foot before the other,<br /> Newborns beneath cornerstones <br /> Of new lives, and Isaac, whose name <br /> Was mirth, bound to the well-worn stone,</p>  <p>Knowing, as mothers know, that God<br /> Destroyeth the hope of man, <br /> Hope and mirth bound over <br /> For the promised land.</p>  <p><em>(Originally published in </em>Artful  Dodge<em>, as &ldquo;Traces&rdquo;)</em></p>
