          <h1>Cairn Stone</h1>
          <p>This is the rock he lifted<br />
            to lay upon a cairn<br />
            in a high place.</p>
          <p>This rock, warmed by the near sun,<br />
            felt right, somehow, in his hand.</p>
          <p>He decided to carry it down<br />
            to his mother, who lay in bed,<br />
            recovering.</p>
          <p>It is so easy to please<br />
            a mother. Just to think of her<br />
            for a moment, from a high place,<br />
            and to carry that thought to her</p>
          <p>in the form of a stone.          </p>
