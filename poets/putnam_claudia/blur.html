          <p>Your father coming <br />
            home lateâ€”a cougar <br />
            vaulted the road,<br />
            blazed up the driveway.</p>
          <p>He floored it,<br />
            but the lion outran<br />
            his highbeams, vanished<br />
            on the hillside.</p>
          <p>Of course I thought of you.<br />
            Who sprang<br />
            fully formed into our lives<br />
            and died. </p>
