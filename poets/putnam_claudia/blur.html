  <h1>Blur</h1>  <p>Your father coming <br /> home lateâ€”a cougar <br /> vaulted the road,<br /> blazed up the driveway.</p>  <p>He floored it,<br /> but the lion outran<br /> his highbeams, vanished<br /> on the hillside.</p>  <p>Of course I thought of you.<br /> Who sprang<br /> fully formed into our lives<br /> and died. </p>  <p>(Originally published in <em>Poetry East</em>.<br /> Appearing in <em>Wild Thing in Our Known World</em>, a chapbook.) </p>
