<h1><strong> All the Wisdom in the World</strong></h1>
<p> I think of all the wisdom in the world, </p>
<p> of all the many wide-eyed moons </p>
<p> I've stopped at night to look into, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> of all the lies I've ever crooned, </p>
<p> of hummingmoths, and airplane clouds </p>
<p> that pass without a single sound, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> of lakes that I will never swim, </p>
<p> and stars that I have counted from </p>
<p> dark seas of grass in my backyard. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> He kissed me, softly on the lips. </p>
<p> Who knew...&nbsp;&nbsp; who knew that it could feel like this ?</p>
