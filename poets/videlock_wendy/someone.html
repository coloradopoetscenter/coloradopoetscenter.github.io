<h1><strong> To Someone I Never Knew</strong></h1>
<p> When I was small I dreamed when I was big </p>
<p> that all the towels in the bathroom </p>
<p> would be warm and orange, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> a giant egg, deeper than a cello's boom </p>
<p> and softer than a violin </p>
<p> would be my only bed,&nbsp; </p>
<p> and in the living room, </p>
<p> the river's edge,&nbsp; </p>
<p> a sycamore, a giant swing, and you, </p>
<p> approaching in a wood canoe. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Yes, you were a giant, too.&nbsp; </p>
<p> I often thought that you were God.&nbsp; </p>
<p> More often I mistook you </p>
<p> for something cruel, </p>
<p> or someone human </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> and beautiful, yet the sounds </p>
<p> of water, evening, and the loon </p>
<p> have ever brought the thought of you, </p>
<p> my silent love, my long, deep breath, </p>
<p> my child heart's first brush, with death. </p>
