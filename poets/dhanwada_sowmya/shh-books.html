        <p>How easy it is<br />
          to slip away or shirk,<br />
          all the responsibilities,<br />
          Of cleaning the muck<br />
          that makes up your room?<br />
          Of changing&nbsp;the sheets<br />
          that reek of gloom?<br />
          Of cleaning your desk<br />
          with books stacked sky high?<br />
          Of reading that subject<br />
        that repeatedly makes you sigh?</p>
        <p>When all around<br />
          you are surrounded by the world<br />
          both Dystopian and Victorian,<br />
          and many unknown.<br />
          You pick one up<br />
          hope to just get a bite<br />
          but before you know it,<br />
        It&rsquo;s already night.</p>
        <p>You get so lost<br />
          in the world you see,<br />
          you never want to leave it,<br />
          It fills you with so much glee.<br />
          You never want to part<br />
          with the heroes of strength,<br />
          their hearts of love<br />
          which go to incredible lengths,<br />
          or, the heroines,<br />
          who are strong and daring,<br />
          unwavering in their sight,<br />
          setting the pages ablaze!<br />
          Their words and action<br />
          of bone chilling suspense<br />
          forever keeps you wanting,<br />
        for that little romance.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s a magical world,<br />
          where anything is possible,<br />
          so why on earth, would you want to leave it<br />
        to do something sensible?</p>
