<h1>AÂ Prince with my Last Name!! </h1><p>(published on Thrive Global on  International Women&rsquo;s Day, March 2017)</p><p>Where is that knight,<br />  the one is shining armour,<br />  who&rsquo;s supposedly made of steel,<br />  but hearts filled with valour?</p><p>Why didn&rsquo;t he slay the mighty dragon,<br />  climb to the tallest tower,<br />  brave the perilous quests,<br />  awaken me from infinite slumber?</p><p>Where is my hero of dreams<br />  for whom we are told to wait,<br />  whose single glance spins you dizzy,<br />  whose touch makes you faint?</p><p>Maybe he was stuck,<br />  temporarily caught in the journey,<br />  Maybe stuck in traffic,<br />  at the corner of gloom and morbidity.</p><p>Or maybe he could be having a fun time<br />  forgotten his entrusted duty,<br />  In that case what am I doing here,<br />  waiting for him to rescue me?</p><p>I have to get real,<br />  and stop this wishful thinking!<br />  Men just aren&rsquo;t like that,<br />  they aren&rsquo;t made to your liking.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t waste my whole life,<br />  waiting for a gallant horseman.<br />  Oh, for goodness sake!<br />  This is 21st century, Woman!</p><p>I alone will dare the challenges,<br />  brave the risky waters,<br />  sail the seven seas,<br />  to the land of infinite wonders.</p><p>I will dig my own gold,<br />  and find my own fortune,<br />  no need for a fairy godmother,<br />  or that ridiculous potion.</p><p>My skills are mine own,<br />  my success, no one else&rsquo;s,<br />  Just you wait and see,<br />  I will move mountains&nbsp;!</p><p>And if perchance a miracle occurs<br />  And I do Happen to marry a man<br />  In that case, I&rsquo;ll be the FIRST, a Pioneer!<br />  Because he&rsquo;ll have to take my last name.</p>
