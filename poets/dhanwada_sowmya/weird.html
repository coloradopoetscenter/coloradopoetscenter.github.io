<h1>Am  I Weird?</h1><p>(A common  question from teenagers when they do not get accepted easily by the society-  Published on Poets Unlimited, May 2017) </p><p>What  is it with people <br />  and  the differences they see? <br />  the  existence of a double <br />  for  any person, just can't be?</p><p>What  I would give <br />  for  no judgments or comments? <br />  I  am not doing the jive <br />Just  talking, just semantics.</p><p>The  awkwardness, the silence <br />  how  I wish to forgo it. <br />  I  am just like anyone else <br />  I  want people to know it.</p><p>Countless  people brushed me off <br />  because  of the way I speak. <br />  My  mannerisms, my style <br />  have  charged many a critique.</p><p>I  comfort myself by saying <br />&quot;Who  cares, what they say&quot;? <br />  but  how much reassuring <br />  can  a person really belay?  </p><p>So  is it the only solution <br />  to  conform hopelessly, <br />  willingly  rid yourself of ammunition <br />andgo to the abattoir helplessly.</p><p>To  be chopped, cut and murdered <br />  devoid  of all personal antiquities, <br />  I  can't fathom that kind of life <br />  That  can't be the end of this soliloquy.</p><p>I  will learn to love myself <br />  all  the good and the bad, <br />  I  already know I can't be shelved <br />  I  am unique and glad.</p><p>To  hold your own <br />  to  stand tall and proud, <br />  to  whatever situation <br />  that  may be bestowed.</p><p>These  things are new to me, <br />  But  with this newfound hope <br />  I  will embrace this new me, <br />  and  no longer mope.</p><p>I  am kind, smart and beautiful <br />  already  achieved what few <br />  never  thought possible, <br />  I  shouldn't feel blue.</p><p>I  will proceed with my life <br />  as  I have before, <br />  But  this time with my head high <br />  Not hanging low!!!!</p>
