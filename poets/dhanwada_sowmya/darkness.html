        <h1>Darkness</h1>
        <p>I don't wish to see  the light of tomorrow <br />
          only to be in the dark  of today <br />
          hiding in my shrouded  burrow <br />
          where I should want to  forever lay.</p>
        <p>Blanketed in my sweat  tears <br />
          I was long ago awoken <br />
          by the chanting,  pleading leer <br />
          of the thoughts that  lay unbroken.</p>
        <p>It's an unending  stream <br />
          with no point of  origin. <br />
          It never ceases to end  but gleams, <br />
          with the dark promise  of possession.</p>
        <p>and so I lay  enthralled <br />
          riding out the waves, <br />
          with my fists balled <br />
          hoping that reality  isn't as grave.</p>
        <p>&quot;Maybe it will  end!&quot; I think <br />
          every second that  passes by <br />
          but now I am eclipsed <br />
          by the loneliness that this  silence buys. </p>
