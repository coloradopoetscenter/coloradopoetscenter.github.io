<h1>Darkness</h1><p>I don't wish to see  the light of tomorrow <br />  only to be in the dark  of today <br />  hiding in my shrouded  burrow <br />  where I should want to  forever lay.</p><p>Blanketed in my sweat  tears <br />  I was long ago awoken <br />  by the chanting,  pleading leer <br />  of the thoughts that  lay unbroken.</p><p>It's an unending  stream <br />  with no point of  origin. <br />  It never ceases to end  but gleams, <br />  with the dark promise  of possession.</p><p>and so I lay  enthralled <br />  riding out the waves, <br />  with my fists balled <br />  hoping that reality  isn't as grave.</p><p>&quot;Maybe it will  end!&quot; I think <br />  every second that  passes by <br />  but now I am eclipsed <br />  by the loneliness that this  silence buys. </p>
