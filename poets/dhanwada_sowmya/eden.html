<h1>Eden..</h1><p>(published  in Tajmahal Review, Volume 16, Number 1, June 2017)</p><p>I  wish that there was a world<br />  without  consequences or decisions,<br />  where  the eerie quietness would startle even the bold,<br />  and  the mind does no derision.<br />  <br />  but  so it can't be, I am told,<br />  every  nuance or nonchalant move,<br />  is  as precious as gold,<br />  the  very idea of it makes me bellow.<br />  <br />  I  wish there was a world<br />  where  we are free from thoughts,<br />  where  regret has no foundation,<br />  and  the mind has not fought.<br />  <br />  where  there are no battles to be won,<br />  no  pain to endure,<br />  where  we can have fun,<br />  nothing  to moor.<br />  <br />  And  so it's true<br />  without  thought and reason,<br />  where  would we be?<br />  running  freely and unsuspectingly as the bison.<br />  <br />  In  the end though, I wish a world<br />  where  my mind does not function,<br />  where  all my cards, I fold<br />  and,  for once, enjoy the glorious procession.</p>
