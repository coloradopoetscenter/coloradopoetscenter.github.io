          <h1>General Syntax</h1>
          <p>A better world shall emerge on account of this. A general is  just<br />
an anybody, events, places, things I could tell you about to make<br />
a nerve end squeal.<br />
<br />
Age wrinkles the body, withers the tome. I want so much to become<br />
meaningful, meaning to be understood, the events, places, things<br />
which relay force. Always there has been some loss on some shore.</p>
          <p>Americans never quit, 24/7 openness, we will be prepared to  say<br />
            something meaningful, do things. I am an old soldier and so see<br />
            war from far away. I mean this literally, as I am on Venus watching<br />
            the unusual gas activity. There are interests about.<br />
  <br />
            Build me a son, I say, and I will show you a river. There, in my dreams <br />
            I hear footsteps, crying, the green rustle of reeds. In a war there is<br />
            no victor if you consider the reeds. The sedges we encountered<br />
            there were always on the up and up unless we slept there.<br />
  <br />
            It is fatal to enter the sedges, and it is part of life. Life is a lively<br />
            process to fail winningly. I meant victory, you win some and you<br />
            wake up with a feeling, as far as anybody is concerned<br />
  <br />
            life is a lively process, as is concern, a general empathy. Syntax<br />
            youâ€™ll have to do yourself, like an old soldier marching out orders<br />
            or was it barking? Age wrinkles the body . . .<br />
  <br />
            Our government has kept us within our borders, as governments<br />
            do by law. Part of the American Dream is in the borders, where they<br />
            hover. The best luck of all is to be born into some kind of dream.<br />
  <br />
            The soldier, above all others, is an American who never quits.<br />
            The soldier, above all others, waves his bayonet. The world is in a <br />
            quandary over unusual gas activity. Interests lie. O build me <br />
            a son toward openness. There is no security on earth. </p>
