  <h1>Major Lure</h1>  <p>Could I have but one moment to remember, shine and fear,<br /> where were we, what bright shore? It’s duty, honor, country<br />  in that order of concretization, they told us that.</p>  <p>I am concerned for the general well-being as I do not think<br /> this stratagem is well understood. I mean I have just returned<br /> from events that lead me to believe age wrinkles the body.<br /><br /> I suppose in a way I have known war, though that old scoundrel<br /> rarely played by country. The rules being the biblical injunction against <br /> sleeping when on duty. There are bound to be insidious<br /><br /> marches, sedges. My first recollection is that the foot knows more<br /> than it can say, and we should’ve listened to that, the bright morning<br /> fierce in the birds that we thought were the forest.<br /><br /> Never give an order you intend not to keep. Young soldiers always<br /> die and the tragedy is for what order of belief? Duty, honor, country,<br /> region, town, biome. These are areas of concern.<br /><br /> One cannot wage war with old soldiers. Under no circumstances<br /> should their sleeping be disturbed. Our country is now fit<br /> for an ailing king. There is no substitute for the facts<br /><br /> which are they died hard, those savages. Our enemies are about us<br /> as we are about them, in the world, I mean, no escape. Objects relay<br /> force and place. Years wrinkle the skin but our enemies wither in chains.<br /><br /> On an island you are remembered for a duty cleaning cells. March<br /> came and went with nary a breeze. This country I am concerned for,<br /> as is anybody for their town. Sir, what is sweet, there is no substitute<br /> for freedom, I mean the world.</p>  <p>(<em>Kenyon Review</em> on-line, 2009)</p>
