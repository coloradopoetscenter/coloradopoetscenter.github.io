  <h1>Seen and Felt Watching</h1>  <p>&quot;No  single perspective.&quot;<br /> The various watchings of the neighborhood.<br /> The trees watching (silver maple) also<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the silver of oxides<br /> which are salts watching the earth<br /> in  its &quot;no single valence.&quot;<br /> From here the dam is a purple wall.<br /> From here I am under the earth.<br /> As if a mine is a place also because of watching.<br /> From  space we gather a sense of immensity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;but no one's seen  in.<br /> No one is the name of perspective.<br /> For  context let's assume a bowling alley<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;stellar precision  of pin's variety of placing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up  and down.<br /> To the left is another league<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and to the right  is a meteoric supply company.<br /> Each of these is its own aesthetic immensity.<br /> Now  multiplied by the lack of a single perspective.<br /> It's dust motes from Mercury, Andromeda from Uncle Lou's,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(mercury making  &quot;surface&quot; seem so much illusion.<br /> On  the road to the shore there's a &quot;little moon&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;from my window,  there's an immense silver surface<br /> suddenly in the car. No single person is driving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though there's a  thermal quickening of next to.<br />&quot;A  next to.&quot; Felt wallet.<br /> When I get to the globular cluster I will join,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;a light very  slowly which might be a mine.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition  digging&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a seen and felt.<br />  From  there the bowling motion of won plenitude. </p>  <p>(<em>Electronic Poetry Review #8)</em></p>
