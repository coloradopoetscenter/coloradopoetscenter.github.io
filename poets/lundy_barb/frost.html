<h1> Before the Frost </h1>
<p>Hindu lotus span the north end of the pond and </p>
<p>goldfish congregate under their wide leaves.</p>
<p> Early September runs the high fever of July.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She lifts out aqua azolla and parrot feathers. </p>
<p>Sets them in the washtub with blue flag iris. </p>
<p>All to wait out winter in the potting shed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind the waterfall, honeysuckle stretches the </p>
<p>lattice wall where a border of forget-me-nots </p>
<p>crowd the lavender petals of mourning brides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water lilies remain year round. Sink deep below </p>
<p>the liquid surface when winds chill. She envies </p>
<p>months of drifting in slow and silent shadows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aches to retreat from expectation. To </p>
<p>delay demands until a spring sun stirs </p>
<p>buried inspiration in her bones. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
