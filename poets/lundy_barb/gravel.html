<h1> The Gravel Maker </h1>
<p>She pounds </p>
<blockquote><p>stones harvested near spider lilies on the beach,</p><p> stones hidden in the ferns beneath lancewoods,</p><p> stones that tell their interiors at the touch </p><p> of her questioning palm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She pounds </p>
<blockquote><p> heavy stones, dug out, then pushed and dragged,</p><p> stones she leaned into her hip to carry,</p><p> stones that swell to a cairn guarding her chair</p><p> under the almond tree, in front of her house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She pounds</p>
<blockquote><p> stones into rocks and rocks into pebbles, and </p><p> pebbles into crumbs of pebbles. Scarred fingers </p><p> cup raw fragments. She pitches them into a heap </p><p> that puddles, piles, then pyramids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She pounds</p>
<blockquote><p> with a hammerhead driven by her right arm. </p><p>The dust of transformation swirls around her. </p><p>Settles on her eyelids, between her toes. She strikes fragility and shatters the fiction of stone. </p>
