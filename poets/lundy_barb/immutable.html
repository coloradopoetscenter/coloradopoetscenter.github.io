<h1>Immutable
</h1>
<p>Thousands of years of glacier defrosted</p>
<p class="indent"> The Roman Marcellus kept at it</p>
<p>not far from Denver</p>
<p class="indent"> until he conquered Syracuse</p>
<p>revealing an ice age wooly mammoth </p>
<p class="indent">ordering destruction to all but Archimedes.</p>
<p>carcass reclining in slush.</p>
<p class="indent"> The old mathematician, engrossed in making circles in dust</p>
<p>The big find made big news </p>
<p class="indent"> ignored a command to come along</p>
<p>so no one listened to the guy</p>
<p class="indent"> and the enraged conscript thrust his sword for kill</p>
<p>who asked why everything was melting.</p>
<p class="indent"> leaving the problem unsolved.</p>
