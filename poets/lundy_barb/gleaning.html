<h1> A Gleaning </h1>
<blockquote><p> (Ancient Egypt recognized three seasons)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Born in akhet, the season of inundation </p>
<p>under skies shrouded by clouds </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to walk</p>
<p>free of the land. </p>
<p>My toes dig into the slick stick of mud </p>
<p>and I pull the weight of ground </p>
<p>on my journeys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Born before peret, the season of sowing</p>
<p>the season when strong earth </p>
<p>receives seed, I miss the </p>
<p>incense of just opened soil</p>
<p>of walking between rows </p>
<p>furrowed and tilled </p>
<p>readied for bulbs and cuttings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Born before shemu, the season of growing, </p>
<p>season of bees and of worms,</p>
<p>I walk past wheat stalks and branches </p>
<p>bowed with berries. Until a ritual of </p>
<p>tongue and teeth appears in dream</p>
<p>until I wake to gilt sunrise </p>
<p>until I pull and pick to reap my first harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>MacGuffin, </em> Fall 2003)
