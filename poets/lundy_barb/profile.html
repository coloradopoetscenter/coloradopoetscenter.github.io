<h1> Profile </h1>
<p><em>(van Gogh by Toulouse-Lautrec) </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hand records far more than I see. </p>
<p>This late afternoon Vincent sits </p>
<p>alone in a corner </p>
<p>of the Tambourin Cafe. </p>
<p>I set out cardboard, pen and chalk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Air coils around him. White light </p>
<p>bleaches his red beard </p>
<p>starches blue wall shadows. </p>
<p>Ginger eyes often reflect liquid terror</p>
<p>but today I capture impenetrability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steam of dying rises from inert </p>
<p>arms. In stark contrasts, with rotating </p>
<p>rhythms, I assume the raw </p>
<p>convulsions of his brush. Sketch </p>
<p>reckless lines. Use bold suffusions of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sulfurs, malachite and cyanics. Dusk </p>
<p>devours my view as I rough in a glass </p>
<p>of absinthe. Vincent, leaning on </p>
<p>brittle steps, drifts into the </p>
<p>darkfall, a man already forgotten.
