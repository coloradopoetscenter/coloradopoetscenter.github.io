  <h1>Springshine </h1>  <p>Sneakers creep to guard <br /> his secret grin, half shy<br /> under touseled blondness.<br /> He holds behind him<br /> Treasure.<br />&ldquo;Flowers, Mama.&rdquo;<br /> Bright in his muddy fist<br /> daffodil trumpets on tiptoed  stems,<br /> harbingers of fluid warmth.<br /> We share aware their glow<br /> prepare to care and grow.<br /> A gift of love to banish coldness<br /> A gift of life to promise newnessâ€”<br />  Springshine!</p>  <p><strong>from <em>Glimpses: a Memoir in Poetry</em></strong></p>
