  <h1>Evergreen </h1>  <p>Sunday  dawns<br /> bright  on autumn aspens.  <br /> Tender  early light<br /> quickens  clarity.<br /> Computer  hum confines,<br /> cozy  walls close in.<br /> Pull  on jeans and boots,<br /> escape  to solitude<br /> retreat  to canyons<br /> where  bracing breezes<br /> stir  crisp October grass.</p>  <p>Cross  and re-cross <br /> dry  Four-mile Creek.<br /> Hop  on river rocks<br /> like  the wary puma<br /> hidden  above.<br /> Listen  to silence<br /> steep  in sunshine--<br /> alone  but not lonely.</p>  <p>Down  in the draw<br /> a  solitary pinion <br /> kneels  to the earth<br /> in  pose of devotion.<br /> Needle-fingertips<br /> reach  for the far bank.<br /> Bitter  winter snows<br /> nearly  broke its back,<br /> but  not quite. </p>  <p>The  miracle is<br /> the  tree didn&rsquo;t die.<br /> Bent  double,<br /> scarred  in submission,<br /> its  roots survived.  <br /> On  the sun side, new limbs,<br /> green  arms stretched up<br /> reaching  for light. <br /> A  leader branch emerged fresh<br /> re-birthed  from roots of the old.</p>  <p>Surprised  by joy <br /> Alone,  not lonely <br /> Bent,  not broken <br /> Reborn<br /> Ever  green.</p>  <p><strong>from <em>Glimpses: a Memoir in Poetry</em></strong></p>
