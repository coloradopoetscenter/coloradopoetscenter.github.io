title: Chelly Gardner-Smith : When I am With God

<h1>When I am With God</h1>
<p>This morning I lie awake<br />
And I am aware, again, of<br />
The still, thick wonder of You.<br />
Come creeping into my imagination and life,<br />
Unimaginable, unattainable<br />
Permanent, penetrating You.</p>
<p>You remind me of the sky.<br />The largest thing to my senses<br />Clear, full of stuff called oxygen<br />That leaves those deprived of it<br />  Dead, in minutes.</p>
<p>And vast, forever<br />I do acknowledge You.<br />And the bigger than the sky<br />Eternal Person of you<br />I can&rsquo;t imagine<br />With wonder and fear<br />And longing and laughter<br />In my bed, in my head<br />  Under the earth&rsquo;s shadows and motions.</p>
<p>You, beyond of any distance.<br />You, the radiant<br />You, still to my ear but<br />Thundering to my insides<br />  Like a waterfall.</p>
<p>I am in your mist now.<br />Opening, unleashing<br />Gaping like a hungry sparrow<br />Down-load<br />You Down-load You.<br />Rewire, reconnect, replace<br />I&rsquo;m willing, breathing breath deeper than sleep<br />  To receive You, oh Beyond of the Beyond.</p>
<p>Empty sight of my sight<br />Hearing of my ears<br />Sighs of my heart<br />To become like You.<br />For unfading, dislodging<br />  Permanent You.</p>
