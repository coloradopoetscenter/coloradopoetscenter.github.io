<h1>Ritualistic Americans</h1>
<p>I knew you somehow<br />
So different from me<br />
So yang to my yin<br />
So black to my white<br />
Concentrated city to my open fields</p>
<p>But there were rhythms<br />Of forest nights<br />And painted faces<br />And ritual cutting of the flesh<br />  For the club of lonely hearts</p>
<p>Listening to Diq-lark<br />Our gamma wave guru<br />We allowed our veins to<br />  Be drawn to the compulsions</p>
<p>And yet we never met<br />Over the years we became so practiced<br />That we mastered<br />Every syllable that made us sing or tap<br />  If I had a hammer</p>
<p>In my little Kansas farmhouse<br />To your pounding New York City<br />A Dragon named Puff eating toast and jam<br />The mystic messages seeped into our<br />Brain-bop-de-boom<br />Chants of&nbsp;  &quot;She loves you,<br />Yea, yea, yea &quot;<br />A message we needed and getting no<br />  Satisfaction from Baby Love.</p>
<p>Abraham, Martin and John,<br />Don't throw our love away<br />We wondered if heaven had a stairway and spent<br />A wild night in a California Hotel.<br />  It was the highest price we ever paid for a good  time.</p>
<p>About the time they said, &quot;Send in the  Clowns,&quot;<br />We were dancing like crocodiles.</p>
<p>Let's stay together, loving you whether<br />Times are good or bad, happy or sad.<br />Let it be, Let it be, Let it be,<br />  Always WE, WE, WE</p>
<p>In spite of our separation<br />We learned the codes<br />And all the symbols<br />Touched each other, felt the fever<br />Lived the myth, Motown, my town,<br />  It was all about you and me.</p>
<p>We paid our money to keep the witch doctors  talking;<br />You in your hot summer night cruise of main  street<br />  And me on my rainy day Monday.</p>
<p>We sang together miles apart<br />Tapped, cried, carved them out.<br />I can still recall the places and so can you<br />We have our tribal tattoos grooved in memory  passages<br />  Of gray matter.</p>
<p>Entrenched rhythms: We knew the unholy writ<br />Of Bobby Joe and Billie Jean<br />  And feared the oracles.</p>
<p>The album covers still detailed in our minds<br />Like an ancient tableau Queen<br />  Stomp, stomp, clap.&nbsp; Stomp, stomp, clap.</p>
<p>So hum me a little, you so called stranger<br />Whistle me a little more, as I wait behind you  in line.<br />You were there at my initiation into adulthood.<br />We were engraved together<br />By the bop-de-she-bop bop<br />  Umareikin clan. </p>
