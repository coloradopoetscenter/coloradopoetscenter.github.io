              <h1>Cancer</h1>
              <p>My body is the mat<br />
The doctors take out and shake<br />
And prod with pokes and needles<br />
Lying on its back<br />
So wide open to rigors complete</p>
              <p>My spirit lives inside this<br />
                Atrophy of flesh<br />
                Saying, &ldquo;Why preserve this moth eaten ruin?&rdquo;<br />
                I must abide here longer<br />
          Hating this mat, but needing the rental space.</p>
              <p>Dilapidated wretch, spirit cave, body bag<br />
                Spirit lives<br />
                Spirit tires<br />
                Spirit gives<br />
          Spirit expands</p>
              <p>Body dies.</p>
