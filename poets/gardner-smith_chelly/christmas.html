<h1>Christmas Morning 2005/ August 8</h1>
<p>The dream listed 10 objectives<br />
To redefine my life<br />
And the time, the time that had happened&hellip;<br />
To be reunited with my first love<br />
It was a matter of my doing what was listed<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The matters, they came, upon the printed page,<br />
One at a time<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I, given the list, was wished well<br />
By his mother, and father and sister and friend&hellip;<br />
A beautiful friend, he had, with golden hair and  blue eyes,<br />
Who kissed me on the corner of my lips, next to  my cheek<br />
But my love was the man of my youth,<br />
The dark haired man, tall and the first<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We were at a camp of sorts<br />
We were there serving and he was leading<br />
My job was small<br />
A sentinel to start the day<br />
Line up the children in a merry way<br />
And he was there<br />
And I saw the date to be August 9th,<br />
The day we were to be wed<br />
When he stood alone at the altar<br />
When I didn&rsquo;t meet my plane<br />
And when I was waylaid, or something<br />
And I wasn&rsquo;t there to take his hand<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now his anger was justified<br />
His silence and sadness and eyes pleading<br />
And my heart bleeding<br />
Wanting him again<br />
On August 9th<br />
&nbsp;<br />
His mother was gentle, his father informing<br />
Sit as a soldier by his door<br />
Not as a girl darting about<br />
But grave-faced and determined<br />
Saluting him emotionless<br />
His mother gave me the list of ten<br />
The ten that would turn back time<br />
And make him mine<br />
Her sister, she said, was a teller<br />
Who never got it wrong.<br />
Would I do the list? Would I do it right?<br />
Come back to them?<br />
She did not say,<br />
She only said I would not be there on the day I  was not.<br />
The first time it was August 9th,<br />
And now the re-doing could take place<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So I hugged his mother<br />
And she hugged me back and I began the list<br />
The treacherous list of tasks<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The snow was deep and the winding roads were  narrow<br />
That ran down the mountain from that camp<br />
I gave him a hug, a wrenching, promising,  hopeful, fateful hug<br />
And he told me about August 9th, and that he  would be there.<br />
He said we could fall together on his bed&hellip;<br />
But that would betray the list<br />
So instead he lathered up his hands with warm  white suds<br />
And slid them strongly over my breasts,<br />
With my shirt on<br />
I cried for him and told him<br />
I&rsquo;d be back on August 9th<br />
For task one,<br />
The roads I managed<br />
The trees gave way and I didn&rsquo;t slide into the  trenches of death<br />
I made it home<br />
To my now home<br />
Some twenty-eight years from that mountain camp.<br />
I had my list, and each thing, it did appear<br />
And I did them one by one<br />
Under the roof of another one I love<br />
Like making a recipe, innocently<br />
e so unknowingly </p>
<p>Magically, critically, empirically I did them<br />
Right under his nose<br />
I was making time disappear<br />
And I was going back to August 9th.</p>
<p>More tasks came,<br />They were not hard, not hard to me<br />The fourth one made me cry<br />As I unwrapped the human doll<br />From its clothes and found it<br />Not quite right<br />I wept as I kept the doll<br />It was just a doll to him<br />But something more significant<br />It had to be to me.<br />&nbsp;<br />I blended the magic drink<br />In number nine<br />That tasted like a blueberry yogurt shake<br />I drank it right from the blender<br />And he asked for a drink too<br />And maybe a taste for his daughter<br />Whose time was being erased<br />As we drank<br />I shared it<br />Oh, they would not die<br />But be forever changed by August 9th.<br />&nbsp;<br />One last task, one last task<br />To add a heap of earth and egg and sugar<br />To my mix<br />The earth, home of worms and decay, but do-able.<br />I would drink it down<br />The sugar would help<br />&nbsp;<br />It was night and I thought<br />Of how I would dig up the cup of earth<br />And where I would get it<br />A message comes from beyond<br />His mother, she is smiling<br />She is knowing<br />I am going to my August 9th<br />And babies will be born thereafter<br />And there will be no more need for lathering<br />On top of shirts<br />&nbsp;<br />And his dad is there<br />And he is proud<br />Proud of my not dying<br />Proud of all my doing<br />Getting fitted for a tux<br />&nbsp;<br />And a smile is newly cracking<br />On his face that had been so sad<br />And imprisoned, remembering<br />The former August 9th<br />And he is going to be my bridegroom<br />And I am coming<br />As soon as I eat the cup of earth.<br />&nbsp;<br />But the four cats we owned<br />I noticed as I looked out the window<br />Were outside<br />And two wolves were making their ways toward  them<br />  In their innocent play</p>
<p>Wolves, damned, ungodly, lurching, advancing  wolves<br />Kitten licking its paw unknowing<br />Another curled in a soft shape to take a nap<br />  I am seeing, I am seeing</p>
<p>Fix the cup and drink it,<br />It is the early morning of August 9th<br />Drink and mix<br />Or save the damn kittens<br />Drink and leave<br />Or stave off the wolves<br />I run, I roar<br />I bat the wolves from under the bed<br />That rests in my driveway outside<br />The wolves gnash and retreat slowly<br />Another task done, but not the task<br />That will turn back time<br />I am awake now and it&rsquo;s Christmas morning<br />  2005.</p>
<p>The earth is still where it was, unbroken.<br />The cup is clean and white.<br />My friend, the man I also love<br />Is sleeping beside me<br />I have let the other one down<br />It&rsquo;s all gone, it&rsquo;s all unraveling<br />Oh the truth and hope I had<br />  In my dream of August 9th.</p>
