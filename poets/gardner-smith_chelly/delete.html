<h1>Delete</h1>
<p>Tonight I deleted from myphonebook</p>
<p>All the names and numbers</p>
<p>Of all the supposed helpers</p>
<p>That were there to protect</p>
<p>MY DAUGHTER</p>
<p>After what that creep did toher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were guardians atlitem,</p>
<p>A mediator or two,</p>
<p>The district attorney,</p>
<p>The family therapist,</p>
<p>Her therapist,</p>
<p>Her and my therapist,</p>
<p>Her counselor at school,</p>
<p>The officer who took thereport,</p>
<p>The lady who asked her the necessary questionsfirst.</p>
<p>The lady who asked her necessary questionssecond,</p>
<p>The officer who made the videotape of heranswers,</p>
<p>My attorney, and other attorneys who wielded their wayinto the case.</p>
<p>The number for the victim's resourcecenter.</p>
<p>Her best friend whose parents said she must back awayfrom her.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist at thehospital,</p>
<p>The counselor at thehospital,</p>
<p>The night duty nurse, the day dutynurse,</p>
<p>The name of the judge and hisdivision,</p>
<p>The case number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All those people who we hoped would help her andus.</p>
<p>All those people trained to help her and us, </p>
<p>But never really helped her orus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She found her strength</p>
<p>And the courage, and thegrit</p>
<p>And the anger to get better without them and </p>
<p>In spite of them.</p>
<p>She took the tonic from her own magnificentsoul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was the onlyremedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course God knew how it would turn out </p>
<p>From the beginning</p>
<p>But, He too hoped one ofthem</p>
<p>Would step outside their professionalsuits</p>
<p>And jargon to see just once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHE WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL&nbsp; </p>
<p>And not something to talk about </p>
<p>Over pens and papers</p>
<p>Tsk, Tsk, Tsk</p>
