              <h1>Delete</h1>
              <p>Tonight I deleted from my   phonebook</p>
              <p>All the names and numbers</p>
              <p>Of all the supposed helpers</p>
              <p>That were there to protect</p>
              <p>MY DAUGHTER</p>
              <p>After what that creep did to   her.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There were guardians at   litem,</p>
              <p>A mediator or two,</p>
              <p>The district attorney,</p>
              <p>The family therapist,</p>
              <p>Her therapist,</p>
              <p>Her and my therapist,</p>
              <p>Her counselor at school,</p>
              <p>The officer who took the   report,</p>
              <p>The lady who asked her the necessary questions   first.</p>
              <p>The lady who asked her necessary questions   second,</p>
              <p>The officer who made the videotape of her   answers,</p>
              <p>My attorney, and other attorneys who wielded their way   into the case.</p>
              <p>The number for the victim's resource   center.</p>
              <p>Her best friend whose parents said she must back away   from her.</p>
              <p>The psychiatrist at the   hospital,</p>
              <p>The counselor at the   hospital,</p>
              <p>The night duty nurse, the day duty   nurse,</p>
              <p>The name of the judge and his   division,</p>
              <p>The case number.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>All those people who we hoped would help her and   us.</p>
              <p>All those people trained to help her and us, </p>
              <p>But never really helped her or   us.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She found her strength</p>
              <p>And the courage, and the   grit</p>
              <p>And the anger to get better without them and </p>
              <p>In spite of them.</p>
              <p>She took the tonic from her own magnificent   soul.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And that was the only   remedy.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Of course God knew how it would turn out </p>
              <p>From the beginning</p>
              <p>But, He too hoped one of   them</p>
              <p>Would step outside their professional   suits</p>
              <p>And jargon to see just once.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>SHE WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL&nbsp; </p>
              <p>And not something to talk about </p>
              <p>Over pens and papers</p>
              <p>Tsk, Tsk, Tsk</p>
