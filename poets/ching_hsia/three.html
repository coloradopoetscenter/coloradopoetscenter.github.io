Taipei, </strong><strong>Taiwan. 1975)</strong></p> <p>There is a kind of speech<br /> Sweeter than native accent<br /> When you hear it you will shed tears<br /> And return from this world<br />  Back the one you came</p>  <p>Home is the place －<br /> Wherever you hear<br /> Dripping from the eaves<br /> Your nose becomes sniveling</p>  <p>  <strong>( Translated  by the author, Hsia Ching). Published in</strong><br /> <strong>Poetry  Sky Journal No.9, Spring 2007)</strong></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I always want to catch the beauty of the nature<br /> Eagles’ soaring, fish’s surfing, and creeks’ singing<br /> When it is caught by words I find no pleasure－<br />  Like fireflies putting in a bottle, disappointing</p>  <p>  <strong>(Translated  by the author, Hsia Ching. Published in </strong><br /> <strong>  Poetry  Sky Journal No.10, Summer 2007)</strong></p>
