          <h1>The Fall of a Grey Whale</h1>
          <p><strong>－</strong><strong>  In memory of the 20th Century</strong>          </p>
          <p>A big bang following the mighty strike<br />
            In the boundless twilight of the Eve<br />
            The tail of the twentieth Century, like<br />
          A grey whale falls back into the vast wave</p>
          <p>Breaking billows splash in all directions<br />
            Like what happened in history; All commotions<br />
            Will soon return to serenity<br />
            Be it the trumpet of war and tragedy<br />
            An enduring romance in days of old<br />
            Or the groans of hunger and cold</p>
          <p>The memory of human beings, you see<br />
            Is  but an evening  breeze over the sea<br />
            Now, all in all, we can only fix our sight<br />
            At a gleam of hope, in morn’s dawning light</p>
          <p>                                                <strong>(Translated  by C. W. Wang. Published in The Chinese PEN, No.144,</strong><br />
