<h1>Prediction </h1>  <p>There is one thing I cannot tell now: <br /> When <br /> Where <br /> And how <br /> Will I droop like a sunflower with the sunset <br />  Before alluring chorus arises among insects. </p>  <p>There is one thing though I can: <br /> The poem<br /> The fame <br /> And the man <br /> Will be buried in the vast ocean of words , <br /> Until there appears a diver for pearls </p>  <p><strong><em>(Translated by Wei Ma. Published in The Chinese PEN,</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>No.103,  March  1998. Taipei, Taiwan)</em></strong></p>
