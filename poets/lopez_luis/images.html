<h1>Images of San Luis </h1>
<p>Often of late </p>
<p> And far from this poor </p>
<p> Tin-roofed-made-to-like adobe church </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> I have seen a votive candle burn low in a red glass </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Sole illumination in this dark corner </p>
<p> Of a chipped plaster image </p>
<p>Of San Luis de Gonzaga</p>
<p> Church patron </p>
<p> Standing two feet high </p>
<p> Yellowing surplus over faded black cassock </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Eyes downcast, seeking heaven </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> This is where my father stood to make his peace </p>
<p> When times were difficult to </p>
<p> Ask forgiveness of stubborn sin through his namesake </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> And where I now stand </p>
<p> Drawn from afar to make my difficult peace </p>
<p> With the memory </p>
<p> Of his tobacco and whiskey breath </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> L. Luis Lopez </p>
<p> From <em>Musings of a Barrio Sack Boy</em></p>
