<h1>Tom&aacute;s </h1>
<p>Mam&aacute;. Go see for yourself. </p>
<p> Puro had babies. He's under the porch. </p>
<p> Listen. You can hear them from here. </p>
<p> I wonder how many. </p>
<p> I can hardly wait to give them names. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Santo ni&ntilde;o, Tom&aacute;s. </p>
<p> Puro can't have babies. He's a he. </p>
<p> Adem&aacute;s, es un perro, and dogs </p>
<p> Can't have kittens. Only las gatas. </p>
<p> Que imaginaci&oacute;n tiene este ni&ntilde;0. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> But, Mam&aacute;, it's true. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Tom&aacute;s, if you tell lies, </p>
<p> Your tongue will turn into a snake's, </p>
<p> Como dice in las sagrada biblia </p>
<p> Cuando Ad&aacute;n mordi&oacute; la manzana en Eden. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Pero Mam&aacute;. . . </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> And no one will believe you when you </p>
<p> Have to tell the truth. </p>
<p> El ni&ntilde;o Jesus never told lies, </p>
<p> And he made his mother very happy. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> But Mam&aacute;, you can hear them from here, </p>
<p> And, anyway, the priest told a big lie </p>
<p> At church on Sunday. He told the people </p>
<p> That baby Jesus was born of a virgin. </p>
<p> Everybody still believes him. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Ay Tom&aacute;s. Go name the kittens. </p>
