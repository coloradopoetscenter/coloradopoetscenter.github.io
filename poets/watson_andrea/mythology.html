              <h1> Mythology Of Your Nights </h1>
              <p> You turn on the porch light</p>
              <p> in that moment between twilight and dark:</p>
              <p> little catch of breath, and your dead grandmother</p>
              <p> kidnaps you, 40 freckles on her inner thigh </p>
              <p> spilling out like stars snapping open. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> Not what you asked for, this haze</p>
              <p> of chimera, strange tock-tock of pi&ntilde;on</p>
              <p> at her hearth. No, you want to see just-night,</p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> want to hear Esquibel&rsquo;s junk-dog complain</p>
              <p> about poor food, no food, his cursed</p>
              <p> coyote life chained to a light pole.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> But you taste your grandmother&rsquo;s coffee:</p>
              <p> bitter grounds mixing with day-old cream,</p>
              <p> 3 sugar cubes she positions side by side </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> at the bottom of the cup with crack</p>
              <p> of lizard&rsquo;s tail: When you roll one finger </p>
              <p> around its rough rim, poco a poco sweetness</p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> dissolves into heat, and 12 bizcochitos float </p>
              <p> from that ancient oven, scent-of-anise falling </p>
              <p> from dusky heavens of abuelita&rsquo;s dough. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
              <p> Warning: Turn off the porch light o leave </p>
              <p> it on. It makes no matter. You sit at the chartreuse</p>
              <p> table, sampling constellations and crumbs, scatter </p>
              <p> warm clouds onto her kitchen floor, momentito,</p>
              <p> she says, then some moon remembers your ransom. </p>
              <p>&nbsp; </p>
