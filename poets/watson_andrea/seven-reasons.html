<h1>Seven Reasons Why Frida Kahlo Is Alive And Well In Taos</h1>
<ol><li>	Open tap: Eske&rsquo;s Pub: Diego lifts<br />  a microbrew, dreaming a mural of you, amber<br />and naked, with nine strong communists. </li><li>Three porcelain dollies from Dallas try on your cape <br />  of midnight at a little shop, all the while watching <br />out for the evil monkey you lost in 1946.</li><li>	Meanwhile, the child you would never have <br />  miracle-dances in a courtyard right of the Plaza,<br />her gypsy&rsquo;s skirt sewn with ribbons and veins. </li><li>Pain of the iron rod weeps at the infants&rsquo;<br />  headstones <br />  (back of the camposanto). Its tears grow tomatillos--<br />green like your loneliness</li><li>	Or coral, lining the robe of la Virgen in the tiny church <br />  of two altars. Braids piled about her head are a volcano,<br />spewing your mysterious tint of coyoac&aacute;n blue. </li><li>	Soft road shoulder near San Cristobal, and the biker<br />  who resembles Dennis Hopper invites you to swing <br />your leg over; fire-glow near the wheels means climb on.</li><li>	Looking back, the vanishing horizon beneath<br />  the forehead of Taos Mountain is your eyebrow: <br />  a single dark sunset.<br /></li>
