              <h1>Readings / Workshop Availability </h1>
              <p>I have taught for  many years and have held&nbsp;numerous writing&nbsp;workshops for children and  adults. I was Language Arts Instructor and Team Leader at The Ricks Center for  Gifted Children at the University of Denver and English Instructor and Chairperson of the  Humanities Department at St. Mary's Academy in Denver. I am more than delighted to teach or  hold workshops for grades 3-12&nbsp;and also&nbsp;adults. My area of expertise  is creative writing, with an emphasis on helping students to find publication  of their work in national student writing magazines and writing contests. I  would be happy to work anywhere, with an emphasis on Colorado  and New Mexico. </p>
