          <h1>By the Ocean</h1>
          <p>Let&rsquo;s take a walk,<br />
            you and I,<br />
            to the end of the road<br />
            where we will watch<br />
            the blue ocean<br />
            in all of its chaos<br />
            and dependability.<br />
            There is nothing<br />
            to say really,<br />
            except for what we notice<br />
            and what we don&rsquo;t,<br />
            and if there are words<br />
            to describe this love<br />
            that crashes<br />
            and breaks<br />
            over and over again<br />
            onto the ever shifting sand,<br />
            then let us say those, too.</p>
