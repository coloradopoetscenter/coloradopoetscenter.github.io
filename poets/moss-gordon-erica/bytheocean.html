  <h1>By the Ocean</h1>  <p>Let&rsquo;s take a walk,<br /> you and I,<br /> to the end of the road<br /> where we will watch<br /> the blue ocean<br /> in all of its chaos<br /> and dependability.<br /> There is nothing<br /> to say really,<br /> except for what we notice<br /> and what we don&rsquo;t,<br /> and if there are words<br /> to describe this love<br /> that crashes<br /> and breaks<br /> over and over again<br /> onto the ever shifting sand,<br /> then let us say those, too.</p>
