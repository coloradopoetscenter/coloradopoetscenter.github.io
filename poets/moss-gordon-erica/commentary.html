  <h1>Critical Commentary</h1>  <p>In an age of overflow, Erika Moss Gordon cuts to the core.  &nbsp;She wields language like a pearled knife, honed to epiphany.  &nbsp;Carving the lyric essentials out of life's odd loaf. &nbsp;Here's a first  book that set a gourmet table and serves up a dazzling meal of bread and water.  - Art Goodtimes, Former Poet Laureate of Colorado's Western Slope</p>  <p>Erika Moss Gordon lives in the now. Her  generosity and strength is echoed in her work. Many of her poems are like  modern Upanishads, gems of hard won wisdom drawn in with every breath. The  poems remind us to take in the landscape of our fears and dreams, to notice  when they converge and when they transform, to examine how these inner  landscapes mirror the natural world. This is a poet who delights in not finding  the answers, but embracing uncertainty with mindfulness and a gratefulness of  the heart.<br /> Kierstin Bridger</p>  <p>Reverent. Humble.  Beautiful. Like tiny lights in a great darkness, these poems lead us into  realms where everything we thought we knew is new again, where everything is  possible, even nothing. Wherever you are, this book will meet you.&nbsp;<br /> Rosemerry  Wahtola Trommer,&nbsp;<em>The Less I Hold,  The Miracle Already Happening&nbsp;</em><br />  </p>
