          <h1>You Cannot Know</h1>
          <p>            You cannot know<br />
            in the time<br />
            right before the darkness<br />
  <br />
            when all things<br />
            are almost blue,<br />
            when the colors are here,<br />
  <br />
            but not<br />
            and there is a soft feeling<br />
            in the eye<br />
  <br />
            of many fabrics bleeding<br />
            together â€“ the aspen grove,<br />
            the dusky grass,<br />
  <br />
            the departing wisp<br />
            of cloud,<br />
            you cannot know<br />
  <br />
            when you walk<br />
            alongside the river<br />
            to talk about love,<br />
  <br />
            where the geese swim<br />
            with their rows of babies<br />
            in the eddy<br />
  <br />
            and you stop on a bridge<br />
            to watch the shape<br />
            of water,<br />
  <br />
            how it fans out white<br />
            over the sunken stones<br />
            or wrinkles convex,<br />
  <br />
            concave,<br />
            you cannot know<br />
            and so you don&rsquo;t<br />
  <br />
            and are left standing<br />
            grateful<br />
            with your blinking eyes<br />
            facing into <br />
            the center<br />
          of things.</p>
