  <h1>PSALM XIII</h1>  <p><strong> </strong>I see you traveling, <em>migrante,</em><br /> and I ask myself:<br /> <strong> </strong>What is the size of the dream<br /> that your much misunderstood feet  carry?<br /> <strong> </strong>How much geography<br /> enters into your absent-minded  eyes?<br /> <strong> </strong>How big is the seed<br />  that your heart preserves for  these occasions?</p>  <p>From <em>Salmos para migrantes,  </em>in <em><u>Five Poets of Aztlán</u></em>. Ed.  Santiago Daydí-Tolson. Binghamton: Bilingual Press/Editorial Bilingüe, 1985.</p>
