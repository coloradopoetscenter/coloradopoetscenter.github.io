  <h1>THAT&rsquo;S HOW THEY ARE</h1>  <p>They make us cry<br /> if we take them seriously.<br /> They remove our mask.<br /> They cut off our vital passages<br /> like an obsidian knife.<br /> They offend, they elevate<br /> they provoke, they produce  tremors<br /> they enlighten, they obscure<br /> they deceive, they hit the mark.<br /> They hurt like the crack of a  whip;<br /> they open paths<br /> through the thicket<br /> of the human heart.<br /> They make life impossible for us<br /> if we commit ourselves.<br /> They can make us laugh<br /> and they produce joy<br /> when they approach us gentle and  light.<br /> They oppress<br /> if they come charged with a dark  substance.<br /> They generate tumultuous states  of affairs;<br /> they build monuments<br /> that remain<br /> through time.<br /> They express great truths<br /> that flow through the ages.<br /> They cause slow deaths<br /> or sudden deaths.<br /> They infuse life<br /> or they resurrect dead people on  the spot.<br /> That&rsquo;s how they are.<br /> That&rsquo;s how words are.<br />  1990</p>  <p>From: <em>Levantando la  palabra</em>: Buenos Aires: Ayala Palacio Ediciones<br />  Universitarias. 1991.</p>
