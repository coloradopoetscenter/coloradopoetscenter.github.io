          <h1>THAT&rsquo;S HOW THEY ARE</h1>
          <p>            They make us cry<br />
            if we take them seriously.<br />
            They remove our mask.<br />
            They cut off our vital passages<br />
            like an obsidian knife.<br />
            They offend, they elevate<br />
            they provoke, they produce  tremors<br />
            they enlighten, they obscure<br />
            they deceive, they hit the mark.<br />
            They hurt like the crack of a  whip;<br />
            they open paths<br />
            through the thicket<br />
            of the human heart.<br />
            They make life impossible for us<br />
            if we commit ourselves.<br />
            They can make us laugh<br />
            and they produce joy<br />
            when they approach us gentle and  light.<br />
            They oppress<br />
            if they come charged with a dark  substance.<br />
            They generate tumultuous states  of affairs;<br />
            they build monuments<br />
            that remain<br />
            through time.<br />
            They express great truths<br />
            that flow through the ages.<br />
            They cause slow deaths<br />
            or sudden deaths.<br />
            They infuse life<br />
            or they resurrect dead people on  the spot.<br />
            That&rsquo;s how they are.<br />
            That&rsquo;s how words are.<br />
