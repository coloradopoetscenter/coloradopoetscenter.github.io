<h1> Blood Sisters</h1>
<p> Through the tiny </p>
<p> magic of a fine grade paper </p>
<p> I see my mother - her wide-eyed </p>
<p> wonder. </p>
<p> Again; she waits for me to discover </p>
<p> the words of another poem. </p>
<p> Mother is anxious , she is excited as if </p>
<p> I were her </p>
<p> (only chance?) </p>
<p> The artist, the designer, the writer </p>
<p> every possible greatness </p>
<p> imagined </p>
<p> There is something desperate </p>
<p> in that moment - </p>
<p> something primitive and </p>
<p> raw, like the torn flesh </p>
<p> of a living creature </p>
<p> The blood gush moment </p>
<p> that pumps its hot scent </p>
<p> into the air and just then . </p>
<p> we were no longer mother and daughter </p>
<p> but tied and true blood sisters </p>
