<h1> An Irregular Line</h1>
<p>open air mart&mdash;a breeze ruffles </p>
<p> and gathers the skirts </p>
<p> of plain blue and grey dresses </p>
<p> black woolies, stove-stacked </p>
<p> above flat, brown or shoes </p>
<p> of black that slide through </p>
<p> shuffled sounds above unkempt walks </p>
<p> small, round white caps cover plain hair, </p>
<p> tied and secure beneath delicate chins </p>
<p> a small defense against poor weather </p>
<p> an irregular line of birth-widened hips </p>
<p> hidden beneath toddler's hands </p>
<p> light blue or white-swaddled babies </p>
<p> between row after row of yard sale goods </p>
<p> the restless, sounds of hungry children </p>
<p> and an obvious, occasional </p>
<p> horse-drawn cart </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
