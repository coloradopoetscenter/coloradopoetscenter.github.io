<h1> A Paper White Moon</h1>
<p> In the long, dark night, on the threshold </p>
<p> of blossom time, the fragrant atmosphere </p>
<p> becomes heavy with lament </p>
<p> In one thought, your eyes outshine a galaxy, </p>
<p> I realize such brilliance has made me blind . . . </p>
<p> My competitive edge is this; the blade of my pen </p>
<p> and a paper white moon full of unwashed dreams </p>
<p> I plunge into the purple depths to find </p>
<p> the phantom lines between life and merciful release </p>
<p> I drift into the realm of rhyme and sleepless dreams </p>
<p> that numb my eyes to human passion and deceit </p>
<p> In the first hour, I rouse myself </p>
<p> from a worthless coma, </p>
<p> throw off the night's kimono </p>
<p> and ease myself in the onsen and embryonic steam . . . </p>
<p> The soft sounds of babbling jets, soothe the ear </p>
<p> like well read sonnets, caresses the soul and skin </p>
<p> afresh, like the sounds of summer rain </p>
<p> The steam drapes the curves of my shoulders </p>
<p> with a warm cradle, like a mother's arms... </p>
<p> I am weightless and content - behind my eyes </p>
<p> I compose murmuring lines with the ancient rhythms </p>
<p> of water drums. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Spring flowers - the buds burst elegant and content, </p>
<p> a moss covered path softens my steps, </p>
<p> the gown of dawn is sober, smooth and gracefully pink </p>
