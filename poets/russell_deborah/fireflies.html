Small pleasing patches of yellow that illuminated the spirit with the same childish joy of chasing fireflies.I walked with a new born pace, in the place of centuries of soul seeking steps. All those, that had come before me. Each step, was an anticipation, a discovery of things known and unknown. This is the way, I thought to myself. This is the way we should learn to live, as if the next step will open the gates of purpose and direction. </p>
