<h1> Through The Valley</h1>
<p> In whispered sigh, the wind lifts a sleeve of cedar </p>
<p> The doves lift their voices and wings in sudden flight </p>
<p> In upsweeps of clouds, on the horizon, neither </p>
<p> Twilight nor dawn breaks away from the dark of night </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> The doves lift their voices and wings in sudden flight </p>
<p> An ambered light filters through the valley and trees </p>
<p> Twilight nor dawn breaks away from the dark of night </p>
<p> The memory lifts in a misty shape of leaves </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> An ambered light filters through the valley and trees </p>
<p> Silence follows her dreams across mountainous land </p>
<p> The memory lifts in a misty shape of leaves </p>
<p> To form a melody in movements of her hand </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Silence follows her dreams across mountainous land </p>
<p> Hope dispels in rivulets of image and peace </p>
<p> To form a melody in movements of her hand </p>
<p> When poetry comes quietly within the reach </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Hope dispels in rivulets of image and peace </p>
<p> A red tail hawk circles in dreamscape atmosphere </p>
<p> When poetry comes quietly within the reach </p>
<p> One writes a new arousal in the eyes and ear </p>
