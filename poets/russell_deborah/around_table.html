<h1>Around the Table</h1>
<p> around the table </p>
<p> shuffling feet and cards </p>
<p> hacking coughs and muttering </p>
<p> over camels and pall malls </p>
<p> the unfiltered kind </p>
<p> they were the remains </p>
<p> of the men of men </p>
<p> talking about the good old days </p>
<p> that never were </p>
<p> day after day, always the same </p>
<p> my father sat among them </p>
<p> telling his joke </p>
<p> he only told one joke </p>
<p> it would run </p>
<p> as far as he could take it </p>
<p> and then some... </p>
<p> at times he'd say just one word </p>
<p> everyone would laugh </p>
<p> knowing what comes after </p>
<p> one by one their hands folded </p>
<p> and dad's eyes kept fading </p>
<p> turning lighter shades of grey </p>
<p> the sparks of friendships </p>
<p> mostly ashen, now... </p>
<p> around the table </p>
<p> children ran in and out </p>
<p> among the legs of table, aunts </p>
<p> and uncles, cousins </p>
<p> daughters and son </p>
<p> buffet dishes warming </p>
<p> on the side, under lids </p>
<p> filling empty spaces </p>
<p> conversation failed to start </p>
<p> mother asked me if I thought </p>
<p> he really loved her </p>
<p> I replied with sinking heart </p>
<p> yes, of course he did </p>
