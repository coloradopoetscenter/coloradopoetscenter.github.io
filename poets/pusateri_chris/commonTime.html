  <h1>Excerpt 1 from <em>Common  Time</em></h1>  <p>Each thing being metaphor,<br />&ldquo;you&rdquo; are not the &lsquo;you&rsquo; I met effortlessly over<br /> breakfast, <em>you</em><br /> is a word that yields<br />  to some other symptom of significance.</p>  <p>You might say <em>fraud</em>, your hands rich with printer&rsquo;s ink,<br /> your forearms forming X, an article of effacement<br /> in an answer that does not insist, yet set<br /> in parliamentary distinction, chic flue a <br /> sidewise of something subsequent,<br /> the plum dust of wonder<br /> never feels itself settle.</p>  <p>Nostalgia is mortal and  completes<strong> </strong>us<br /> before we are ready.Â  </p>  <p>Mnemonics its somber prerogative,<br /> promise like sovereigns divested of red<br /> sputter, bodiless<br /> like pods to the bottom. </p>  <p>(Originally published in <em>Mandorla</em>)</p>
