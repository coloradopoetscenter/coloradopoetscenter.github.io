  <h1>Excerpt 2 from <em>Common  Time</em> </h1>
<p>There would be a pistol loaded with our dreams.  We would enact a massacre by shooting people with those dreams, and like  heroes in the movies, our revolver would never run out of bullets.</p>  <p>I ache in Maine,  its green waters and tiny whitecaps<br /> so unlike  my deposits <br /> but the  movement<br /> (perhaps  the way I wish to move <br /> might  resemble<br /> in tonnes the  way the water<br /> shuffles  toward shore<br /> where it  argues with itself<br /> before  retreating.</p>  <p>Some things we cannot recognize as nutrients,</p>  <p>There are symbols &amp; sheets and days made blank:</p>  <p>Its salt, residual.</p>  <p>Like licking the hand of a lover<br /> after it’s been inside  of you—</p>  <p>you learn something that way,<br /> though you may not want it. </p>  <p>(Originally published in <em>Colorado  Review</em>)</p>
