          <h1>Excerpt 3 from <em>Common  Time</em>
          </h1>
          <p>When seeking something,</p>
          <p>we often encounter Aristotle&rsquo;s aphorism<br />
            in which our failure to achieve something</p>
          <p>is a failure of will rather than something innate.</p>
          <p>Like finding pot &lsquo;if I really wanted to, I could,&rsquo;<br />
            when &lsquo;could&rsquo;; is a term<br />
            incongruous with the figure speaking it.</p>
          <p>It was a shirt<br />
            that read &lsquo;travesty&rsquo;<br />
            rather than being a travesty.</p>
          <p>I&rsquo;ll be the judge of every Winnebago.</p>
          <p>And from the clouds emerges  a ship<br />
            from the ink which is<br />
            the tattoo which is the image<br />
            of something punted.</p>
          <p>Rule number one in the city: you never just *throw* yourself down on  a patch of grass.</p>
          <p>The rubber band sits on the counter, fastening nothing.</p>
