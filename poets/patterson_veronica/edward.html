              <h1>My Edward Hopper Eye, My Claude Monet</h1>
              <p>I walk the streets at night<br />
  shutting first one eye, then the other.</p>
              <p>The left eye is Hopper, its lens<br />
  too clear for comfort, the hard lines<br />
  of a town you're stuck in, always<br />
  August, noon or midnight.</p>
              <p>The right eye haloes each street lamp.<br />
  Threads of light dissolve each tree into<br />
  the next in Paris, spring,<br />
  dusk.</p>
              <p>Who could live in that Hopper city?<br />
  Once I married there and became<br />
  that beautician with hennaed hair<br />
  and too many secrets, none her own.</p>
              <p>In Monet's garden of well-tended horizons<br />
  I sleep three nights, then someone delivers<br />
  a newspaper. In the damp green air<br />
  events rub off on my hands.</p>
              <p>In every storm<br />
  one eye watches bare light<br />
  shock the land, split a tree;<br />
  the other sees each gutter<br />
  alive with wings and the rain rinsing.</p>
              <p>And so the eyes argue:<br />
  one strips, one clothes. One cauterizes,<br />
  one salves. And I<br />
  walk on.</p>
