<h1>Margaret is a field</h1>
<p>  In the field goldenrod thickens. Weeds grow so tall<br /><span class="left">that by August you can't see.</span><br />Margaret is a path through the field and she is where<br /><span class="left">the path disappears.</span><br />Margaret is the house with the red door and the room <br /><span class="left">with the maroon floor where four children sleep a troubled sleep.</span> <br /><span class="left">When they wake, she sends them outside and they raise a calf, </span><br /><span class="left">a collie, each other.</span><br />Margaret smokes so she can see each sigh. She smokes constantly. <br /><span class="left">The ashtrays overflow. Later, as therapy, she will make ashtrays. </span><br />Margaret is a dream Margaret once had. Margaret drinks toward the dream <br /><span class="left">she can&rsquo;t quite forget and doesn't dare remember. She wakes </span><br /><span class="left">to choose sleep.</span><br />She is a wrong turn Margaret took or several turns; she is bad about directions.<br />Margaret is not a door that opens nor cruelty nor a bed nor forgiveness, <br /><span class="left">but she can be forgiven.</span><br />I repeat, Margaret is a field and a path through the field and the point <br /><span class="left">where the path disappears. She will not come to find you.</span><br />Because she will not come to find you, you start out deep <br />  <span class="left">in this gold and weedy field.</span></p>
