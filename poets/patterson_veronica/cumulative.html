              <h1>The Cumulative Heron</h1>
              <p>In the fog, she hears the heron&rsquo;s croak,<br />
                the ship&rsquo;s horn, <br />
          some third sound.</p>
              <p>Her maiden name begins with an S<br />
                not unlike the heron&rsquo;s neck, curves she hides<br />
          in her signature.</p>
              <p>Through binoculars is not the same heron<br />
                from the fishing boat,<br />
          from beneath the surface.</p>
              <p>When they married, neither had seen<br />
                a great blue heron or they didn&rsquo;t know they had<br />
          among other things.</p>
              <p>She studied eloquence.<br />
                Now she puts stones in her mouth<br />
          to make a shore.</p>
              <p>The heron walking like bamboo<br />
                is the heron hunkered in rain<br />
          is the ancient arrow.</p>
              <p>As she drives home from the house of a dying friend<br />
                a heron flies obliquely across the road,<br />
          its shoulders hunched.</p>
              <p>Of the 10,000 winds, <br />
                none troubles a feather <br />
          of the heron&rsquo;s ruff.</p>
              <p>She reads many poems in which <br />
                there are herons. When she looks up, a silence<br />
          rests most of its weight on one dark leg.</p>
