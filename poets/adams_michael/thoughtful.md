<h1>The Thoughtful Speech Of Stones</h1>
<p>I’ve spent a long time learning the songs of wind and water, <br />
the slow and thoughtful speech of stone.<br />
I have asked the young stream that rises from the head of  the valley--<br />
Do you  believe in the ocean?<br />
and await its answer.</p>
<p>I want to know what these scattered coyote <br />
bones have to tell me and what you’re trying to say <br />
when you sigh in sleep in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Every road that has ever cracked, turned to weeds and dirt,<br />
every building that has crumbled to ruins, every <br />
garden that has gone wild --<br />
these are close and kin to me.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a river boil red with spawning salmon,<br />
felt the howl of the wolf set my flesh afire,<br />
watched, with the stone-still patience of the hunter, <br />
the solar turnings of a year.</p>
<p>I have sought within the hollow where breast and arm meet<br />
and on the dark undersides of river stones; <br />
in the eyes of 30 years of lovers; <br />
in dusty books and new books; and in the light that lingers<br />
after the sun has set.</p>
<p>I’ve forgotten now what it was I was looking for --<br />
a glimpse of eternity, the touch of the infinite?<br />
There is no end, only the seeking and the road, <br />
a hard and dusty beauty.</p>
