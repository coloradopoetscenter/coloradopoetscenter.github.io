<p>All is Well/--This was what Charlie Parker/Said when  he played, All is Well.<br />
<em>Jack Kerouac</em></p>
<p>Horns &amp; whiskey <br />
&amp; the light graying into dawn, <br />
with Bird or Billie, or Ornette <br />
on the turntable, the only thing <br />
in that shitty basement apartment <br />
worth a damn.<br />
Only two or three of us left by then,<br />
so late, the hardcore, the sleepless,<br />
fueled by that inexhaustible <br />
need to grab it all, whatever<br />
it was, as much as we could, <br />
knowing all the while <br />
we could never get enough.</p>
<p>God, how we would talk, argue,<br />
fight for hours -- jazz, the Beats,<br />
the blues &amp; rock &amp; roll, <br />
Nixon, Kissinger, the war &amp; all<br />
the goddamn liars.</p>
<p>There was booze &amp; weed,<br />
plenty of it, but none of us <br />
burned as hot as you --<br />
the white crosses <br />
so your body could soar <br />
as high as your heart <br />
&amp; the Qualudes to drag you,<br />
finally, into dreamless sleep.<br />
Cockroaches &amp; coke in the sugar bowl, <br />
none of us were saints, but you,<br />
you thought nothing could touch you.</p>
<p>&amp; by God, for a while nothing could,<br />
holy &amp; shining, the way <br />
you had with women, &amp; that horn<br />
raw &amp; sweet at the same time, so much<br />
beauty &amp; pain at once, shards of glass buried<br />
in the pure sands of a wave-washed beach.</p>
<p>You came back but could never come home<br />
from the green hell of Vietnam with a craving<br />
nothing could fill for long &amp; such a love<br />
like I’ve never seen for every <br />
breeze &amp; tear &amp; sunrise.</p>
<p>Oh you could blow, I mean<br />
that horn &amp; you said you wanted to blow<br />
the whole damned laughing, crying,<br />
loving, dying, fighting world<br />
through that horn, breathe it all in<br />
&amp; turn everything that was ugly, holy.</p>
<p>Like that night-turning-to-morning<br />
you said, let’s go &amp; we went up<br />
into the city &amp; the sun<br />
came up orange &amp; cold &amp; you<br />
wet your lips &amp; launched <br />
into Bird -- After You’ve Gone --<br />
while the bridges filled with cars<br />
&amp; the sun burned off the frost &amp; then<br />
you slowed it way down with I Can’t Get</p>
<p>Started, but what it was was you couldn’t<br />
stop &amp; nobody could follow where you went<br />
&amp; none of us could accept what you needed<br />
to give &amp; finally we stopped trying.<br />
It wasn’t just me, I wasn’t the only<br />
one who cut you to the bone, but when you finally<br />
fled Pittsburgh for Denver<br />
on that 3 AM Greyhound nobody<br />
was happy but we all<br />
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>You sent a couple of letters at first,<br />
boasting about all the girls, how bright<br />
the stars were, the huge heart of the night,<br />
a different address every month or so,<br />
&amp; I sent a few postcards to whatever<br />
address I had, with not much to report on,<br />
&amp; soon enough I stopped or you, <br />
I don’t remember.</p>
<p>We all settled into the routines we once said never to,<br />
but I’d think of you sometimes, knowing you<br />
could never settle into anything like a routine<br />
&amp; years later I heard from somebody who heard<br />
from somebody that there was a bum<br />
they found frozen one January morning,<br />
an old vet from Pittsburgh they thought,<br />
with nothing to his name but an alto sax,<br />
who haunted Colfax Ave. &amp; oh, <br />
but could he blow sweet.<br />
