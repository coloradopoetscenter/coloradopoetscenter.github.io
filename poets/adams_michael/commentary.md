<p><strong>STEEL VALLEY</strong> is  Edgar Lee Master&rsquo;s <strong>Spoon River Anthology</strong> on steroids, mega-steroids, moved forward into the 21st century with  all the love and pain and remorseless human dignity in the face of our  crumbling institutions you can ever imagine…..   His form is organic: the  shifting  meter, tempo, and tone of the lines match the mindset of the shifting moments of  our lives rather than fitting one stale archaic French form or another.  His nonlinear leaps from stanza to stanza and  poem to poem are as fine as those of Bly.   And he writes about women with a direct matter-of-fact tone that matches  Bukowski when Buk wasn&rsquo;t in his cups or feeling sorry for himself.<br />

<p>A bittersweet elegy to a by-gone time, of stepping &ldquo;into the  fires in the cathedral shadows of the furnaces, /…Pittsburgh where I was tested  and tempered,&rdquo; Michael Adamsrecords  in the clipped language of his native Monongahela Valley a world of friends and  family living through a turbulent transformation from &ldquo;our city / beautiful /  molten / riven to the core&rdquo; to &ldquo;boarded up storefronts, abandoned downtowns,  suicides and divorces, low wage jobs or no jobs at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s Dust Bowl talking blues, William Carlos  Williams&rsquo; <em>Paterson</em> and Jack Keruoac&rsquo;s  bop prosody road novels, form meets content in <em>Steel Valley</em> as compliments, not opposites, to celebrate an  original voice, a new way to cohere the gestalt.  In the Introduction John Macker calls &ldquo;these  tough, tender-eyed poems and prose pieces at once blue collar and bohemian,&rdquo;<br />

<p>His  is a voice of passion, fierce truth and compassion for all beings. If you&rsquo;re  lucky, you&rsquo;ll get to hear him read in that prophetic, incantatory style of a  Homer or a Ginsberg.<br />
But  whether you experience these pieces in person or in print, have a listen.<br />
