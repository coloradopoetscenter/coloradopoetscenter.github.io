<h1>Critical Commentary</h1>

<p><em>These  are sharp-edged, dark poems that speak a dangerous truth about the health of  humans in these hard times of our earth. They reflect the changed landscape,  the changed life of the body of woman, the body of God, the body of this land  with its newly hazardous terrain. Yet there is light here, water, air, prairie  grasses, and heart. These are poems to pay attention to, about what it means  when health slips like a ring from earth&rsquo;s finger.</em><br />
(Linda Hogan, author of <em>Solar Storms, Dwellings: A Spiritual History  of the Living World</em> and <em>The Book of  Medicines. </em></p>
<p><em>Each  poem in </em>Prayer to a Purple God<em> resonates in primal intensity and regard. Each poem focuses on a  health emergency, the body&rsquo;s vulnerability, the acts of doctors and nurses, and  the vivid inner perceptions of those involved. Simultaneously, astonishingly,  all are painted in terms of larger contexts and presences of earth. In the  critical care unit, one patient is half woman and half bird, one crawls across  the glass in an aquarium like a snail, one has a torch in his skull, one has a  physician illuminate &ldquo;her arteries and shelves/of bone in a ruby gloom, one is  held/ within white-curved wings.&rdquo; Though grounded in the profound struggles and  emotions of the hospital, many of these poems are reminiscent of Neruda&rsquo;s odes  in how they focus and yet open through metaphor and association. This is one  powerful, compassionate, and unique book of poems.</em></p>  <p>(Jams Grabill,author  of <em>Poem Rising out of the Earth, </em>Oregon  Book Award for Poetry, 1995)</p><hr \ />
<p><em>The author of this bold collection is a registered nurse who  relates, through her poems, patient and caregiver experiences culled from her  own years of working in Intensive Care-Coronary Care. There are 24 poems here,  most running two to three pages and most written in short lines, a point of  craft that adds to their power. There is not one moment of easy sentimentality  in these poems. Instead, the author plunges into the grittier side of nursing  and illness--and yet, in aggregate, these poems celebrate the embodied and holy  work of healing.</em></p>
<p><em>In the opening poem,  &quot;The-Trickle-Down-Theory-Of-Health,&quot; Adam, in the Garden of Eden, is  surprised by &quot;The knife&quot; that &quot;separates his ribs.&quot; By  poem's end, we see health slip &quot;like a ring / from earth's finger&quot; (2),  and with this simile we are introduced to the book's underlying metaphor and  also to the poet's technique: dense and sometimes near-extreme imagery that  ranges, in this poem alone, from encyclopedias to acid rain to barefoot  children to librarians to a patient in the dark, &quot;her arteries and shelves  / of bone in a ruby gloom&quot; (2). This accumulation of unrelenting, unusual  images recreates the world of a patient's pain and suffering and the fierce  determination and occasional despair of a caregiver.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Coma&quot; is written from a comatose woman's point of view,  and yet we also see her from the nurse's vantage. In a lovely and surprising  twist, the coma becomes, for the patient, a sort of liberation as &quot;Slowly  she sloughs, / cell by cell, / the old thorn&quot; (15). This patient is not  Sleeping Beauty, who in some fairy tale might be wakened by a kiss. &quot;On  the Fireline&quot; becomes a wonderful metaphor for the daily confrontation of  illness, for the way the nurse, returning daily to tend her patients, also  &quot;coalesces into fire&quot; (16).</em></p>
<p><em>The 5-page poem &quot;Intensive Care&quot; perfectly renders the  physical sense of being alternately caregiver, patient, and family member  within the rarified atmosphere of the ICU (24-28). A patient's blood  &quot;pulls against/ the moon, his breath / this tide going out&quot; (26) and,  as she comforts a waiting family member, a nurse's eyes &quot;beyond clarity, /  unfold a silken language / all their own&quot; (28).</em></p>
<p><em>Other not-to-be-missed poems are &quot;The Holy O&quot; (36),  &quot;Prayer to a Purple God&quot; (38), &quot;Pieta&quot; (44), &quot;A Riot  of Flowers&quot; (52), &quot;What the Body Remembers&quot; (57), and one of my  very favorites, &quot;Anesthesia&quot; (59). In &quot;Anesthesia&quot; the  caregiver lets an anesthetized patient float like &quot;an embryo / tethered on  the end of IV tubing, / floated like an astronaut / in cold stratosphere, / a  naked thing / alone / in the universe&quot; (60). But since these poems are  finally loving, involved, experienced and hopeful, the patient is told to hush;  he is watched over; he is protected. When danger is past, he is reclaimed:  &quot;She will hold you / within white-curved wings. / She will reel you back  in / when you are healed&quot; (60).</em></p>
<p><em>Often  student caregivers are not prepared for the rush of sights and sounds that  accompany pain and suffering. Sometimes experienced caregivers become numb to  those same sights and sounds; we forget how viscerally we were once affected.  We forget too that patients and their families might be total strangers to the  images of hospital or illness, or that patients with chronic illnesses might be  all too familiar with them. Nevertheless, for both patients and caregivers,  these sights and sounds seep into our bodies, our minds, our dreams.</em></p>
<p><em>These poems return us to those primal sights and sounds (and  reawaken in us their emotional and spiritual significance) in language that,  because of the poet's expert, unrelenting use of surprising images, transcends  the word. Reading these poems is like being in the body of the caregiver or the  patient with every nerve ending alive, with every sense primed. Medical and  nursing students might read and discuss these poems after they have been  introduced to intensive care. These poems might spark wide-ranging  conversations or even stimulate students and experienced caregivers to write  their own deeply imagistic poems.</em></p>
