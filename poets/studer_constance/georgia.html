              <h1>Georgia Summer: The Weight of Peaches</h1>
              <p>Sun is heavy through the window<br />
                her bones sharp against my chest<br />
                as I change her diaper<br />
                the lightness of her body thinned<br />
          to this shaking weight.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Battered kitchen shimmered in July</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves of thick heat.</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like an alchemist she scalded the itch</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off Elbertas and New Havens</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stirred juice into sure-jell, her  wooden spoon</em><br />
          <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transforming boiling scum into  thickened gold. </em></p>
              <p>Tenses alternate like electrical current &ndash;<em>is, was</em>-<br />
                  <em>now</em> self  divorced from <em>then</em> self.<br />
                Bottom teetering off the wheelchair<br />
                her grunt tells me she finds the cereal pleasing<br />
                eyes do nothing but reflect light. The long goody-bye.<br />
                Time to lower her onto the throne<br />
                catch her as she pitches forward,<br />
          walk her back into the day</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>the farmhouse was alive with lilacs</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; floors in need of polish.</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heavy sunlight beveled rims of mason  jars</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blackened the bottoms of kettles</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while peach halves, bronzed with syrup</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; securely sealed after their deep dive</em><br />
                  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the pressure cooker</em><br />
          <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaned down like listening ears. </em></p>
              <p>Hair still brown and soft<br />
                brushes my cheek as I lay her back on frayed sheets<br />
                the soreness in my chest weight<br />
                recognizable only much later as grief<br />
                and another day goes out as colors deepen<br />
                into shadow. I lean forward on air<br />
                as if our heads still touch ever so lightly<br />
                over the split blood of peaches.<br />
