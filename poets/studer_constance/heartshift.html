              <h1>Heart Shift </h1>
              <p><em>We&rsquo;ve  got to stop meeting like this</em><br />
                Paul quips the third time he&rsquo;s kicked out of heaven<br />
          wakes up to see paddles in my hands. <em>Idiopath</em></p>
              <p>his doctor writes on his chart<br />
                doesn&rsquo;t know why Paul&rsquo;s heart keeps quitting<br />
  <em>disease  without recognizable cause</em></p>
              <p><em>origin  unknown</em><br />
                but just walking into his room<br />
          I know the way a composer</p>
              <p>looks at a sheet of music and hears a dirge.<br />
                  <em>Too  much pain</em> he whispers<br />
          his body a camera set at the widest aperture</p>
              <p>sensitive to the tiniest light<br />
                his mouth a white line in a long lived-in face<br />
          ten miles down a bumpy mountain road.</p>
              <p><em>Nothing  you say can shock me</em>, ever the jester<br />
                Paul is on mortal notice unless another heart<br />
          can be found. <em>I&rsquo;ve  had every test</em></p>
              <p><em>except  autopsy&hellip;that&rsquo;s where I draw the line</em>.<br />
                Sunlight will take longer to circle his&nbsp; body<br />
          as it lingers over his face in the mirror.</p>
              <p>Blood will fade to thin ink<br />
                writing his signature on the dotted line<br />
          leaving his children fixed for life without him.</p>
              <p>Each breath an act of rebellion<br />
                Paul relearns every day<br />
          how to live in his wrists</p>
              <p>the arch of his foot<br />
                the third intercostals space<br />
          in his jaw bone and eye sockets</p>
              <p>how to retrieve voice and hope<br />
                from defibrillator paddles and call lights<br />
          the shiver of leaves.</p>
              <p>(from <em>Minnesota</em><em> Review: A Journal of Committed Writing</em>,  2003)</p>
