<h1>Hawk, Winter</h1>
<p>Bedtime prayers move apartment walls<br />giving life to silence, as if wings were rising<br />  outside the window.</p>
<p>Snug under his quilt, I read my son his favorite book<br />  <em>Where  the Sidewalk Ends</em> as snow presses hard against the sill.<br />  Somewhere there is always war</p>
<p>a desert or city ghetto where boys try to defeat<br />the enemy with stones<br />  innocent bodies stacked like cordwood.</p>
<p>Life, that white chip that can disappear as quickly<br />as a roll of dice while the soul goes on.<br />  Overnight the pond behind our building</p>
<p>is one frozen blank eye. Overnight trees have naked  arms.<br />Out of nowhere a hawk dives<br />  its eye a great reticulated yellow orb.</p>
<p>Just in time I pull my son into my arms<br />my child who will always be too young to wade<br />  through sauna jungles</p>
<p>to hide waist-deep in mined rice paddies<br />to sleep with one eye open.<br />  Late evening sun transforms the prism in our window</p>
<p>into a rainbow on the wall<br />all the colors within the body: golden fat, soft<br />  and pulpy like the inside of an orange</p>
<p>pink intestines, crimson pools that fade to purple.<br />Our president comes on TV delivering the rat-a-tat-tat<br />  of big guns. Friendly fire. Collateral damage.</p>
<p>Turning down the volume, I watch stern men move silent  mouths<br />but still hear their slogans: <em>God is in our cockpit.</em><br /><em>I am  stronger than you are. Thumb in nose</em>. Far away smart bombs</p>
<p>hone in on targets that have eyes<br />and hearts as shades of red bleed into the desert.<br />  My hands steady the dulcimer</p>
<p>while my son&rsquo;s small fingers caress the strings<br />bestow tiny bursts of heavenly sharps<br />  and flats, his touch</p>
<p>the trembling wingtip of a dove.<br />  <em>Light  candles for his seventh birthday</em><br />  <em>angel  food cake, a magician&rsquo;s set with black cape</em></p>
<p><em>and  gold wand. Balloons filled with ghosts drift toward heaven</em><br />  <em>if I  let go for a second.</em> My love blows soapy bubbles through a ring<br />  that gleams with his brightest breath.</p>
<p>Gentle puffs float through winter dusk, along the rim<br />of the window sill, out into the suddenly warm night.<br />  May the wings I heard be angels</p>
<p>instead of hawks. May the magician&rsquo;s wand<br />make war vanish. May our world not end with a headline<br />  a slogan, a fiction redder than the Cedars of Lebanon:</p>
<p><em>Pax  Americana.</em> <br />Fang baring.<br />  Brilliant display of plumage.</p>
