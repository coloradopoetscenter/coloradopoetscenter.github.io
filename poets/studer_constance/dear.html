<h1>Dear Dr. Williams, Dear Poet</h1>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s  all about pace</em><br />  <em>planting  palms within loamy skin</em><br />  <em>excavating  stories buried deep within bone</em> you whisper</p>
<p>as I bob on the rim of the university bubble<br />float past preachers and salesmen certain<br />  they have the antidote to disease and famine.</p>
<p><em>Poem.  Steady eye at the hurricane-center</em><br />  <em>of  flu epidemics and cancer clusters</em><br />  <em>supplication  to spare a son or father.</em></p>
<p>Hours stolen between patients<br />scribbling poems on the back of envelopes<br />  furtive game of test and balance.</p>
<p><em>Lay  cold metal ear against shivering flesh</em><br />  <em>listen  to the swish of deficient valves</em><br />  <em>as  the anxious heart gallops across open meadow.</em></p>
<p>My offering is about Carla who bled<br />whom I&rsquo;ve left alone inside all those tubes<br />  and wires that need tending</p>
<p>an innocent who didn&rsquo;t know that the miracle<br />keeping her heart dancing &ndash;<em>pacemaker-</em> could also be dangerous<br />  the reason I arrived cold, wet, late.</p>
<p>Pens carry steady light down into the body&rsquo;s labyrinth<br />  <em>part  and weave</em> incisions bloom with looped handles<br />  grey roses, white gardenias. Into the nether-world</p>
<p><em>grasp  red muscle, yellow fat, between metal teeth</em><br />  <em>part  and weave. </em>You voice in my ear: <em>Never mind</em><br />  <em>the  phone, that mad thing, that curse,</em></p>
<p><em>words  demand to be born</em><br />  <em>between  claming a man bronzed by leukemia</em><br />  <em>child  pregnant with child. </em></p>
<p>House still, my son warm in his bed<br />words blow through leaves calling.<br /><em>What  medicine takes apart</em></p>
<p><em>poetry  breathes in whole.</em> Knife and pen join hands<br />take up the dance<br />  whirl and glide, spin face to face</p>
<p>arms encircling arms as they debride scar tissue<br />excise pendulous tumors<br />  sing lyrical songs <em>a  capella</em></p>
<p>with bell-like harmony of hemostats and knives<br />wounds healed by a tiny thread of ink.<br />  Next shift Carla&rsquo;s cheeks are bright peonies</p>
<p>and my poem &ndash; dancing its wild flamenco<br />within her chest &ndash; has just earned<br />  the only grade it will ever need.</p>
