              <h1>Winter Light</h1>
              <p>&ldquo;One sees flame in the eyes of the young, but in the  eyes<br />
                of the old, one sees light.&rdquo; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Victor Hugo</p>
              <p>Winter, stripped down and simple<br />
                is framed by webs of white-feathered branches<br />
                spiked with rime ice<br />
                a canopy luffing in afternoon wind.<br />
  <em>Worst  thing about getting old</em><br />
  <em>is  that no one ever touches me.</em><br />
                Emma unzips her robe, <br />
                an invitation to let me into her life of wheel-<br />
                chair trips between bed and bath<br />
                the swallowing of pills, rolling of lips<br />
          lolling of tongue.</p>
              <p><em>Your  fingers are gentle like my husband&rsquo;s.</em> <br />
                I remove her gown<br />
                her back dry and freckled<br />
                talcum-powder white with one mole<br />
                on her right shoulder that I&rsquo;ve learned<br />
                to skirt around. <em>He  has asked me to marry him again&hellip;</em><br />
  <em>but I  don&rsquo;t know&hellip;he has eight babies&hellip;</em><br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                Coyly she laughs, her eyes kissing a young man<br />
                on bended knee, rose extended. Cloth fitted<br />
                over hand like a bandage<br />
                I wash skin fragile as a leaf.<br />
                Ancient face rises to meet me<br />
                a communion of skin<br />
                and light reflecting off chrome bed<br />
                and her love keeping vigil<br />
                from the dresser. Light blazes into prisms of melting  ice<br />
                like sun in a grove of aspen, air luminous and blue<br />
                shimmering with opalescence<br />
                the familiar sheen she falls into<br />
          before the long night.</p>
