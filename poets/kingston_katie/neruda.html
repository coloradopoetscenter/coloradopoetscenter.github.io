<h1>In My Dreams Neruda</h1>
<p>brings me a white robe, and we walk toward Mexico, </p>
<p>land of <em>phantasmagorica. </em>He brings me cenote water </p>
<p>tasting of sacrificial virgins, their palms of spring green. </p>
<p>In my dreams Neruda brings me eggplant, the sheen </p>
<p>of its purple skin cares about weather. He brings pasteles, </p>
<p>caf&eacute; negro, a pitcher of cream, a green orange, pan dulce. </p>
<p>He brings me Chilean snow, its laughter like a child </p>
<p>on a swing. In my dreams Neruda brings me a carpet. </p>
<p>We explore magic, a church steeple, the purple of <em>arco iris,</em></p>
<p>castle towers. He explains flight, how to cross my ankles, </p>
<p>center myself so that rising feels like falling. In my dreams </p>
<p>Neruda brings me a handful of sand fleas, clay jars </p>
<p>crawling with ticks. <em>You mustn&rsquo;t learn to expect things,</em></p>
<p>he explains. He brings a half grapefruit, serrated, </p>
<p>ready for the tongue. It transforms my language. I speak </p>
<p>Portuguese, then a phrase of Italian. He brings me </p>
<p>quiet pearls, the breasts of women, street signs, arrows </p>
<p>pointing north. Neruda brings me shadows scaling wall, </p>
<p>a bowl of pomegranates, bees mating in a Mason jar. </p>
<p>He brings me a picnic basket, two bottles of wine, </p>
<p>watches me sip alone under a variegated palm. </p>
<p>His hand on the pen, he begins to laugh as if the sea </p>
<p>had just said something funny. He brings me a car engine, </p>
<p>just for the sound of acceleration, the taste of exhaust </p>
<p>on my tongue. He brings me a sparrow, a dead one, </p>
<p>in his outstretched palm. He reads from his book </p>
<p>of questions. I listen to the weather of vowels cross his lips, </p>
<p>watch the tiny syllables of moisture lift from his brow. </p>
