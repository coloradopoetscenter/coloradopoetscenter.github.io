<h1>Homeless Woman under Las Animas Street Bridge </h1>
<p>I shake black sparrows from my hair, shake burrs </p>
<p>and fire ants from my hem. Sorceress of bad language, </p>
<p>fragrance of vodka in a clear bottle, I chew the black juice </p>
<p>from nicotine, release my arrow of spittle. I reminisce </p>
<p>with Bonilla, his Spanish lilt, his Portuguese roots. </p>
<p>Nobody sees him but me. I notch his rifle </p>
<p>with the number of dead, shave the fine hair of his skull,</p>
<p>watch sparrows grapple for the toughest strands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I surround myself with river stones, keep other homeless </p>
<p>from growing too close. I hang mutton and a carving knife </p>
<p>in the cottonwood, deal fifty-one playing cards, a torn joker. </p>
<p>I scatter birdseed just to hear wings, gather chokecherries, </p>
<p>cattails, yucca root. I pull wool over my ankles, inhale </p>
<p>the scent of dumpsters, river mulch, greasy burgers. I stir broth </p>
<p>with a broken twig, sip the frightened leaves of afterlife. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I call to crows in their language, roll out my blue tarp </p>
<p>under concrete sky, under the hiss of tires, night cruisers</p>
<p>with bass tuned full, drumbeats like heartthrobs distilling night. </p>
<p>I build fire. I stain my teeth with chamomile, with river silt. </p>
<p>I crawl into sleep, curl into fetal, wise at protecting myself. </p>
<p>I dream pi&ntilde;on nuts, juniper wine, a forest of pewter light in rain.</p>
