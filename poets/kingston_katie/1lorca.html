<h1>What Does Lorca Own?</h1>
<p>A garden of tangerine eyes, a parade <br />of consonants streaming from the balcony, <br />a city under construction,&nbsp;  all the vowels <br />  of history wrapped in a clean white hankie.</p>
<p>When he closes his eyes the Guardia Civil <br />knock at the door, the garden disappears,<br />  and the pigeons remember a city of horses. </p>
<p>Lorca owns a room full of assonance placating <br />his pen with <em>ohs</em> and <em>ahs</em>. He begins to float, <br />  and the room becomes a river, current and undertow.</p>
<p>When he closes his eyes he sees construction <br />workers, their hands full of hammers; Guardia Civil, <br />  their belts full of sunlight; women in black shoes, </p>
<p>their arms full of vowels. Twenty-six boots cross <br />the plaza, worn-down heels bring him men <br />  filled with bullets and lime. When he closes his eyes </p>
<p>he sees the stray dog approach his knee, the stray <br />dog sniff his crotch, the stray dog lick his face. <br />  His fingers tighten around the pen. </p>
<p>Lorca owns the word <em>Green.</em> </p>
<p>When he closes his eyes, two skies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn  chartreuse, <br />  celadon enters like a waft of sunlight. </p>
<p>His favorite word, <em>Gangrena.</em> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Gangrena.</em></p>
