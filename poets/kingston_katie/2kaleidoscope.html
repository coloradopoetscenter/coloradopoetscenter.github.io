<h1>Shaking the Kaleidoscope I</h1>
<p>I cannot recall violence, only the cigar <br />smoke and the ruined air of traffic, exhaust <br />filling my nostrils, cannot recall <br />pistachios, the way the shell cracks <br />between teeth, or myself dropping <br />from a metal bar chipping my front tooth<br />on happiness, the stain of blood <br />in sand, nothing like the matador gored <br />in the groin, so that my lament rises <br />  up next to Lorca and smells of wet ashes. </p>
<p>I cannot recall the sound of the trolley, <br />its chime diminished by cathedral <br />bells nor the prints my knees left in sand <br />when my mother lifted me to the car, <br />cannot recall the taste of honey <br />nor the voice of the vendor selling split <br />melons, nothing like the pigeon, <br />guttural warble echoing inside the jojoba, <br />iridescent neck collecting sunlight, <br />not unlike this street woman asking me <br />for <em>un peso</em>, her  shoes as silent <br />as the voice that refuses. Not violence <br />to refuse a woman a handful of coins <br />for her story spelled out in the sad <br />  leather of her everyday shoes. </p>
<p>I cannot recall violence, but one morning <br />my son&rsquo;s face turned blue. I forced <br />my own breath into his lungs, cannot <br />recall the sound of waves claiming <br />shore or the way his feet toed-in, <br />only the cadence of silence, nothing like <br />the chain of mountain peaks suffering <br />from lack of rain. I cannot recall <br />the way a knife slices coconut <br />into quarter-moon wedges, cannot<br />recall cleats biting into cobblestone, <br />nor the bull lifting his horns to the groin, <br />the matador spilling onto sand, nothing <br />like the pomegranate or the blue face <br />of a child when his lungs will not pull air, <br />nothing like exhaust filling my nostrils <br />  or pesos dropping into an open palm. </p>
<p>I cannot recall the taste on my tongue<br />when I was saved by the skin-of-my-teeth, <br />nothing like a-nick-in-time, the sharp <br />rasp of tooth against metal punctuating <br />sand with red, nothing like the matador <br />lighting his cigar, the infirmary bed <br />vibrating under his weight, nothing like <br />the word <em>Ol&eacute; </em>etched  in sand as bells shake <br />the sky from its reverie of white distance, <br />nothing like the dog with no collar sniffing <br />my left foot, the dog who stole the eyes <br />of the beggar woman. Pesos are not like violence, <br />they make no sound, unless you drop them <br />into a cup, nothing like the girl pulling a balloon <br />by the string. Her father calls, <em>Mar&iacute;, ven aqu&iacute;, </em><br />  and the balloon rises to the cathedral spire. </p>
<p>I cannot recall violence, how it wears a red <br />hat and stands&nbsp; on the  corner selling news, lives <br />on the beach in corrugated cardboard, changes <br />its name to <em>Passion</em> and stays out long after <br />midnight, cannot recall violence, but by the crack <br />of my teeth on metal, I knew the world resonated <br />with chipped porcelain, that I would go crazy, <br />have fun with it, shake it up, and return <br />to the sound of cathedral bells slicing sky <br />into bite size pieces, nothing like the woman <br />on the corner of <em>Canal</em> and <em>Recreo </em>peeling mangos <br />  into ripe moons that resonate on my tongue. </p>
