              <h1>Listen to Her Face</h1>
              <p><em>Listen to her face, </em>I whisper to my  sister&nbsp; <br />
                we&rsquo;ve come to fill the urn with geranium water<br />
                Listen to the sound of her chin, the slant of her eyelids <br />
                to prune back starchy branches and blood petals<br />
                Listen to the fine hair of her eyebrows <br />
                we drive my mother through a maze of tombstones<br />
                Listen to the pale lid over blue iris<br />
                looking for her parents, Glenn and Charlie <br />
                Listen to her calm yellow skin, the open throat <br />
                our eyes team with clouds of crosses <br />
                Listen to the curl of hair, lace beneath her chin<br />
                voices echo inside us like children calling through tunnels<br />
                Listen to her blue veins, flowers opening on desert <br />
                as if the dark ricochet of their voices can rescue us <br />
                Listen to the bruise below her left knuckle <br />
                how often we have broken the wishbone in two<br />
                Listen to her fingers warming my right hand<br />
                salvaged like a piece of scrap metal put to good use <br />
                Listen to the tender pulse of her neck <br />
                swearing in a language she&rsquo;s never used before<br />
                Listen to her voice as it rises from my past<br />
          reminding me,<em> Bring in the sheets if it rains.</em> </p>
