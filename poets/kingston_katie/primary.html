<h1>Primary Hue </h1>
<p> I want to read poetry, the kind that sheds its skin </p>
<p> and leaves translucence lying on the back step, </p>
<p> or read like starlings, excited birds that chatter endlessly </p>
<p> above my head, shuffling through pages of juniper. </p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t know foreign alphabets or strange insects. </p>
<p> I only know the flutter at the window </p>
<p> when the light goes out. </p>
<p class="indent2"> and the moth has no center, </p>
<p> like my mother&rsquo;s dementia. <em>I remember my neck,</em> she says, </p>
<p> propping her chin in the hammock of her hands, </p>
<p> while I compare the color red to the color red, </p>
<p> trace the burgundy lines of tallow waxed to the kitchen table, </p>
<p> read about medieval castles, their maroon tapestries </p>
<p> strung from doorposts. </p>
<p class="indent2"> I can read all the parts of red. </p>
<p> It starts with an open vein and ends in the Sangre de Cristo range </p>
<p> streaked with pale pink, burgundy, maroon, berry-berry, </p>
<p> classic red, double mocha until I think I am describing lipstick, </p>
<p> and choose process narration. I paint my mother&rsquo;s nails </p>
<p> and her lips to match, </p>
<p class="indent2"> dip the brush in pink coral and stroke </p>
<p> its tiny bristles over her thumbnail, twist the tube marked rose </p>
<p> and stroke her upper lip. I don&rsquo;t conceal anything, </p>
<p> just keep on stroking until I get cause and effect, </p>
<p> until the color of wine tints my memory, until the starling moth </p>
<p> clings to the night shade, </p>
<p class="indent2"> until nothing but red frames the blue opal </p>
<p> of her necklace, and the owl picks up the snake skins, </p>
<p> one by one, wings them away, and I am left </p>
<p> with a familiar alphabet stringing the margin, </p>
<p> the tenacious feet of frail insects clutching the screen. </p>
