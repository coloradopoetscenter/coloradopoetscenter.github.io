  <h1>The Condor</h1>  <p>Dark and lugubrious, his eyes<br /> signify no intent beyond brooding.<br /> All day he has been posed on thermals<br /> as if the land would rise like a hand<br /> and say: Blessings! Blessings!<br /> Observant as a child who watches<br /> the sidewalk for a dollar<br /> dropped by chance along the way to school.<br /> He waits. The dollar's never there.<br /> It is a story like the one they tell prisoners<br /> of a world outside the walls to keep them<br />  simple with hope.</p>  <p>Now he's passed the rift valley<br /> empty of game and descends<br /> smooth as a spent bullet to the Bay.<br /> He feeds there on salmon spilled<br /> by the fishing boats.<br /> It is always less than he wanted.<br /> He dreams of a freshly killed goat<br /> on a grassy hill near Monterey,<br /> a calf, a yearling torn by rocks<br /> or the teeth of wild dogs.<br /> But it is always something less.<br /> Today salmon. Tomorrow a rabid skunk,<br /> a coyote dropped by fever.</p>  <p>The Apache said the bird made thunder<br /> by beating its wings. The Apache said<br /> lightning was born on the condor's eyes.<br /> I tell my son the old legends<br /> but think instead of losses. Think of the doomed<br /> Irish days of my grandfather and the miles<br /> he drifted; his eyes red after a fifth of Jameson<br /> as this great lost searcher's looking out at a world.<br /> Always one which gave less than the dreams.<br /> But he told me the legends. How there<br /> was once a people whose poetry<br /> thundered on Tara's hills, whose eyes flashed lightning.<br /> When the world was young<br /> and no man could measure the breadth of a life.</p>  <p>It was before the factories, before the wife<br /> dead with the third child and the child stillborn.<br /> It was before the friends imprisoned, the dole,</p>  <p>the immigration. I sometimes think, he said,<br /> that life is fine unless you stay too long at it.</p>  <p>We call the condor an endangered species<br /> and like the sound of that captured phrase.<br /> And the condor, his wings transcendent<br /> as an old memory beat: Alexander! Alexander!<br /> With no other worlds to conquer.</p>  <p>Copyright 1989 by Michael Hogan. From Making Our own Rules, New and Selected Poems<br /> (Greenfield Review Press, 1989).</p>
