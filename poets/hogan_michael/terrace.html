          <h1>The Terrace, St. Tropez</h1>
          <p>A girl reclining by an open window.<br />
            I do not say this way<br />
            the only thing one saw that day.<br />
            There was a strip of luminous green,<br />
            pale and cool suggesting the sea,<br />
            or moss on wooden shutters.<br />
            But if on a white canvas I mark down<br />
            some sensation of blue or green,<br />
            each stroke diminishes the one preceding.<br />
            So you see there was, first of all, a girl.<br />
            I, bored and elegant, outside the scene<br />
            at a proper aesthetic distance.<br />
            She, Algerian, darker than almonds,<br />
          almost part of the terrace shadows.</p>
          <p>I do not recall the season.<br />
            It may have been that autumn was soft and new,<br />
            or that it was indeed still summer.<br />
            Ten years ago I would have said<br />
            August, and let it go,<br />
            a soft brush stroke to suggest fullness.<br />
            But now I am hardly certain where the sea ends<br />
            or the sky begins.<br />
            Only my signature seems exact: Henri<br />
            just below the flagstones on the terrace walk.</p>
          <p>She said to me (the day in fact<br />
            the canvas was complete),<br />
            Henri, she said, everything is melting and imprecise.<br />
            And you have chosen to paint me,<br />
            your woman, without character.</p>
          <p>Months later I was telling my friends:<br />
            Algerians have no humor.<br />
            But now the trespass of the years<br />
            demands consideration.<br />
            Could one undo a painting or a memory<br />
            he could say simply: There was a girl<br />
            reclining by an open window.</p>
          <p>But instead I will do a landscape, my last,<br />
            in which each of the leaves will be a girl<br />
            reclining: inexact, characterless.<br />
            Each will represent a painting which commenced<br />
            quite simply, until line followed line and color<br />
            color, filling the canvas,</p>
          <p>and something (one could say purity)<br />
            was lost in the process.<br />
            A single leaf fallen shall be taken to mean<br />
            this same Algerian girl<br />
            who died, I'm told, one year in August<br />
            of nothing very fatal.</p>
