          <h1>Ernest Hemingway - 1961</h1>
          <p>When the sun comes early<br />
            through eastern windows<br />
            and a single horsefly buzzsaws the air<br />
            it is then I rise from bed<br />
            my dreams of amputation, of teeth lost,<br />
            cloaked in the amnesia of another day<br />
          overwhelmed with trivia.</p>
          <p>We make our own rules and lose by them.<br />
            This morning after a breakfast of coffee<br />
            and ice water I walk to the corner<br />
            feeling my liver dissolve in a<br />
            cacophony of stale beer and bad whiskey.<br />
            June drips a melody sweet as rose water<br />
            and the town wakes slowly.</p>
          <p>These things are substance, Mary, not prelude.<br />
            Only what moves us has meaning.<br />
            The rest is lost in a weed-choked yard<br />
            or the gutter with brown cigarette butts,<br />
            orange peels, used condoms.<br />
            When words fail, the hammer drops.<br />
            Living can never be its own excuse.</p>
          <p>I have carried this gun in dreams:<br />
            quiet ones in which a wounded animal<br />
            is given peace by the hunter's grace.<br />
            Now hunter and animal, I find myself<br />
            precipitating an act gentle as June rain.<br />
            And in this dazzling pellet-rain<br />
            I'll sing the best of all men's songs.</p>
          <p>Take care, Mary, of the cats. Smile<br />
            at those who call me coward.<br />
            These last weeks so free of conflict<br />
            are quit also of energy and force.<br />
            I am become abstract as a moveable feast,<br />
            my life arbitrary, capricious as a poem of Pound's.<br />
            Only the gun gives me substance<br />
            this trigger my clearest, most careful line.</p>
