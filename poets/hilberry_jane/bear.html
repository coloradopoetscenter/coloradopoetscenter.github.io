<h1> Crazy Jane Meets a Bear</h1>
<p>&ldquo;I've been looking for you everywhere,&rdquo; </p>
<p> she says when she finally meets him. </p>
<p> She has been chasing the bear, but the bear </p>
<p> is smart. He kneels down </p>
<p> to brush over his tracks with the soft </p>
<p> branch of a fir. He catches a hint </p>
<p> of her scent, and is gone. It&rsquo;s not </p>
<p> that he&rsquo;s afraid of Jane, he just </p>
<p> doesn&rsquo;t want to meet her by himself </p>
<p> in the woods. No one knows </p>
<p> what she might do, if provoked. She </p>
<p> has no fear of bears. She&rsquo;s always wanted </p>
<p> a dance partner taller than herself. </p>
<p> Sometimes she carries a bag of berries, </p>
<p> a slab of ham, to attract the bear, </p>
<p> preferably a grizzly. If she&rsquo;s going </p>
<p> to go to all this trouble, she wants </p>
<p> to find a big one. She knows </p>
<p> he could rip her apart with those strong hands, </p>
<p> knows he could lift and toss her </p>
<p> out of his path, but she&rsquo;s used </p>
<p> to the risk. She muses to herself, </p>
<p> &ldquo;Can a girl propose?&rdquo; </p>
<p> She decides not to stand </p>
<p> upon etiquette. He is afraid </p>
<p> she would embarrass him </p>
<p> if he introduced her to his friends. </p>
<p> She never did have much fashion sense. </p>
<p> &ldquo;I am divorcing my husband and moving in </p>
<p> with a bear,&rdquo; she announces at a party. </p>
<p> Then she plunges her hand </p>
<p> into a pot of honey. &ldquo;Some sweets </p>
<p> I reserve for him,&rdquo; she says, </p>
<p> licking her own fingers. </p>
