<h1> Listening</h1>
<p> You can keep a dead person&rsquo;s spirit with you for four years, </p>
<p> a Lakota healer says, but if you do, you must attend </p>
<p> to nothing else those years, then let the spirit go. </p>
<p> In my yard, a flicker pecks at the dried grass, flight compressed </p>
<p> into its tiny body. Once when my spirit tried to leave, </p>
<p> when I became too scared to live, Rose kept me with her. </p>
<p> She made me meals, put me to bed on her couch. </p>
<p> After she died, I kept looking for a sign&ndash; </p>
<p> the yellow flowers hatching in December, </p>
<p> a tiny rainbow that bloomed between clouds. </p>
<p> I saw someone at the movies last night who looked like Rose, </p>
<p> but younger, happy, motioning and mouthing something </p>
<p> to her lover who had just stepped inside. </p>
<p> The last time I saw Rose, I read to her. </p>
<p> She couldn&rsquo;t speak, but she opened her eyes </p>
<p> and spelled on the chart that looked like a Ouiji board, </p>
<p><em> I&rsquo;m listening. I just like to close my eyes</em> . </p>
<p> It took so long to spell it out. </p>
<p> The woman in the movie theater is alive, </p>
<p> waving at her friend, forming words with her lips </p>
<p> but not saying them because she knows </p>
<p> he can&rsquo;t hear them across such a distance.</p>
