<h1> In Arabic</h1>
<p>In her room in my house, a teenage girl speaks a language </p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t understand, a language she makes into gravel </p>
<p> to fling at her father, across a thousand miles. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Like a mood ring set on a stove, she changes </p>
<p> when she hears her father&rsquo;s voice--the atmosphere </p>
<p> around her body turns dark purple, spiked </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> with yellow-green knives. He tells her to cover </p>
<p> her neck and head. When she argues, </p>
<p> it sounds as if she were being strangled, </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> scraping the bottom of a river whose current </p>
<p> presses her under. In Amman, women stream </p>
<p> the streets, heads scarved. A river can take a girl </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> and pin her to a rock, like an uncle pushing </p>
<p> a child against a wall, his hand bigger than the whole </p>
<p> of her sex. Some Arab women paint their hands </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> with intricate, hennaed patterns, like the swirls </p>
<p> this girl now doodles on the back of her fist </p>
<p> in blue pen, a design with four quadrants, a symmetry </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> with such confidence it must have arisen </p>
<p> from beneath her skin. She has her compass, </p>
<p> her knives. She will survive. </p>
