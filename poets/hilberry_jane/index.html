              <p> In Hilberry&rsquo;s poems, the body is a canvas on which a whole range of experiences are painted: grief at the loss of a sister, the adolescent search for God, sexual passion, and ordinary pleasures such as swaying in a hammock, touching the astonishing warmth of a lover&rsquo;s body, or watching a surfer rise &ldquo;on the joy of a wave.&rdquo; Crazy Jane, an alter-ego figure, makes appearances throughout Hilberry&rsquo;s work, seducing a bear, sleeping in a priest&rsquo;s bed, and generally transgressing social norms. Ultimately, the poet celebrates unconventional choices&mdash;to love both men and women, not to have children, to abandon the attempt to find God in church. She ends up loving the impermanent world and the mortal body, wanting only to touch &ldquo;what&rsquo;s returning to earth.&rdquo; </p>
