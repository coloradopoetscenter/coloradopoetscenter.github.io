<h1>Sand</h1>
<p> I have a tone inside me </p>
<p> that has not been sounded. Or only once </p>
<p> or twice. Once she went straight to the center </p>
<p> of me, once she could have walked through me </p>
<p> like a tunnel. She could have seen sky </p>
<p> on the other side of me. </p>
<p> I could have washed my hands in sand, </p>
<p> then touched her, turned her to sand. </p>
<p> I&rsquo;m the opposite of Midas: I want to touch </p>
<p> what&rsquo;s returning to earth. </p>
