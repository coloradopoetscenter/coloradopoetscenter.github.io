              <p align="left">How we <em>the blue bowl</em> invert <em>except for one white streak</em> like an<br />
  old<br />
  Man with a Mohawk hung from a chandelier <em>a glass to see through</em><br />
  the sky changes <em>again in a busy day</em> makes us tilt up our noses to<br />
  know <em>they&rsquo;re burning blood</em> in Greeley <em>today again adroit</em> adrift as<br />
  reflex relax it&rsquo;s only the <em>neighbors without even shutting off our</em><br />
  <em>machines</em> infernal we say and <em>spit, a knowing we agree on</em> for<br />
  once, though the sky as a <em>forecast for all who can</em> read its stretch<br />
  marks is a herringbone of contention like <em>those plastered over</em> the<br />
  plains with great tattooed faces praising <em>the sun, moon and other<br />
  robins of Fate</em> smiling <em>over our fevers, skies</em> whip-sawed by<br />
  concrete images that make us want <em>to test ourselves against</em> their<br />
  gale force wills, grave skies, skies that tilt like <em>sentinels asleep on<br />
  their feet,</em> skies that move, skies that <em>roar, skies</em> that witness our<br />
  <em>secret drives though we</em> do not miss our home fields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the robins are <em>neither silent nor</em> do they<br />
  leave a trace except <em>as after-poems in slates</em> philosophers used to<br />
  call innocence, something&rsquo;s in the <em>sky, air, wind, we say,</em> and in<br />
  January comes the Chinook with <em>his warm filed teeth</em> from Nevada<br />
  by way of Micronesia to <em>gnaw the selvages of snowcrust we know</em><br />
  the skies the same way we know <em>we&rsquo;re alive, by the flying</em> debris,<br />
  from the <em>prick, the quick</em> from the ghostly split, wanting more and<br />
  beyond that blue is black and the <em>glitter strewn shawls</em> and shoals<br />
  beyond the <em>shrouds we know, wan,</em> blanched by hints we know it<br />
  all already and blot dawn&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gold out <em>window mingles</em> smells of coffee, the color<br />
  we hope is hope, our suns launched <em>into skies of</em> their days, high<br />
  thin skies we barely note as they drive <em>their saxophones</em> to work<br />
  and get hitched <em>under</em>, the sky with a sun which <em>is the name of</em> one<br />
  possible life and <em>the idea</em> we know as <em>we live</em> it, asking <em>What is not</em><br />
  the sky or in or of it&mdash;the dust of <em>deceased volcanoes</em>, flecks of<br />
  radiated <em>skin, strontium</em> mites, neutrino mines <em>glowing in<br />
  commerce</em> city, Cro Magnon <em>angels, skies</em> we see, skies we recall,<br />
  skies we have inside, skies <em>gone missing, skies </em>on milk cartons,<br />
  skies in the eyes of lost girls <em>high in the</em> cabs of eighteen-<em>wheelers</em><br />
  <em>cruising</em> through Wheeling&rsquo;s October with <em>yellow red maple hems</em><br />
  and kids shushing through dry paper <em>skins of God, skies</em> that<br />
  promise, skies that threaten like angry nuns, like arguments <em>that</em><br />
  <em>end with thunder</em>, and a woman bolting from a <em>table, skies</em> that<br />
  feel like blushes at first.</p>
